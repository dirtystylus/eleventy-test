Watched this after _The Killer_ and you can see the line from this film to that one. Alain Delon as Jef Costello (cue the “Yes, Jef!” jokes) is the picture of cool in this one, and I enjoyed all the low-tech aspects of this film. The ending is grim inevitability, foreshadowed from the very beginning by Jef’s pet bird.
