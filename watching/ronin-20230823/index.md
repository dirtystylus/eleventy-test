Very lean and propulsive—what’s in the case doesn’t matter, it’s all about best-laid plans going sideways and high-speed chases. I remembered very little about the plot going in, but distinctly remembered the visceral sound of the engines revving. Love how spatially legible the chases are.

What a stacked cast for the main characters, but even for the smaller roles—Katarina Witt is in this as a famous Russian ice skater!

I thought a lot about De Palma’s _Mission Impossible_ while watching this and my main thought about _Ronin_’s final act is that De Palma could have squeezed a lot more tension in the pivotal ice rink scenes.
