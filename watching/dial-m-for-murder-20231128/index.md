You fool, you do a murder _for_ Grace Kelly

First time watching this—it felt like Hitchcock doing Poirot or Columbo. It makes sense that this originated as a play, so much is conveyed through dialogue. I just rewatched _Rear Window_, where so much of the exposition is done through the camera’s roving eye.

There’s a lot of pleasure to be had in the first half as Tony walks the audience (via Swann) through his airtight plan, but again it’s all very talky. You could imagine a version of this staged using the _Mission Impossible_ films’ gimmick, where the plan is actually dramatized onscreen, even as the audience knows there’s no way it will actually unfold in that way.
