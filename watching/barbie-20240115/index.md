Rewatched with the family since A wasn’t with us when we saw it in the theater. America Ferrera’s monologue still feels clunky—I get that she is the Real World intruding into Barbie Dreamland™, but it lacks dramatic grace. I feel bad thinking that this will unleash a whole slew of movies based on Mattel’s IP that will have none of this one’s wit and creativity.
