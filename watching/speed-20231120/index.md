I have vivid memories of seeing this in the theater with my dad—I think this was the summer my mom was dropping off my brother at college. My dad’s not a big movie guy—my mom was always the one taking us to movies and to the video store. But we really enjoyed this, even if I can barely remember us ever going to another movie together.

Lots of folks putting a lot of extra mustard on their lines in a way that feels very 90s. Also very 90s: the car flying through the air for Keanu and Jeff Daniels’ entrance. It’s wild to see how they staged the action—how much of this would be pure CGI if this were made today?
