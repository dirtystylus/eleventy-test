First time seeing this! Mann really loves stories about men (and it’s always men) who should know better but their obsessions win out. Wild to see how much of the dramatic tension is derived from physical limits of tools, limits that no longer exist—the press deadline for a classified ad, the the slow unspooling of a fax machine on an airplane.

Brian Cox’s Hannibal Lecktor might be more terrifying than Anthony Hopkins’ more famous rendition from _Silence of the Lambs_.

The moments where Graham voices his inner monologue (“It’s just you and me, sport”) made me laugh. Something so very 80s about it. The needle drop at the end also felt like a thing that latter-day Mann wouldn’t have relied on.

I miss Dennis Farina.
