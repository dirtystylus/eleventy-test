I remembered Keanu, Weisz, Swinton were in this, but I forgot: Peter Stormare, Djimon Hounsou, Gavin Rossdale (!). Incredibly silly in parts, and you can feel the cultural weight of _The Matrix_ films from just a few years beforehand. Still, it was fun to watch a comic book movie that wasn’t part of an endless, interconnected Universe™. Crossing my fingers that the sequel actually makes it to screens.
