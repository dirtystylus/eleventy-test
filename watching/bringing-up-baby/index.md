Watched with the girls as part of an early birthday celebration. This isn’t my favorite of the Hepburn/Grant comedies (Holiday >>>) but it did feel like the most accessible one for the kids. They were a bit split on it: S was like, Leopards?!? Cool! But A was a bit exhausted by Susan’s chaotic energy.
