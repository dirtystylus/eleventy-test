Watching the opening credits I thought, why did I bounce off this in the past? And then Ching the butler shows up and I remember. It’s not Breakfast at Tiffany’s-level racism but it’s still pretty bad. 

I did watch it all the way through though, and I enjoyed 3/4 of the cast (Tracy does nothing for me in this role, unfortunately). Powell, Loy, and Harlow though…
