That last scene is still an all-timer.

I get the _Vertigo_ comparisons but upon rewatching this I wonder if this is less about Johnny being obsessed with the memory of Nelly and more that…he just wants the money? It’s all about Nelly’s journey. Nelly’s desperation to have Johnny recognize her is more about recovering her self, than any future with Johnny. It’s fitting that when she sings she seems fully embodied, and is thus able to walk away. Nina Hoss, what a performance.
