Oh, I get it now. Between this (invoking _Casablanca_) and MI:2 (remaking _Notorious_),  Cruise totally has an Ingrid Bergman thing, right? Which…fair, because I love Bergman too.

I like this one more than _Fallout_, maybe because Rebecca Ferguson’s Ilsa Faust gets such a great introduction.

I didn’t remember much before this rewatch, except for some of the shots (like Ethan Hunt’s powerless hand in the smoke-filled listening booth). That and the opera scene, which feels like the kind of sequence De Palma would have absolutely feasted on.
