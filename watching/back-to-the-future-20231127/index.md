Still a delight from start to finish—the 80s really loved an introduction via a slow pan across a busy, humming room, huh? The whole thing just moves, exposition handled without exclusively relying on dialogue. Was genuinely worried Marty wouldn’t make it back!

(Reagan-era values: to show that George wins in the end he has to become the boss, and the bully to Biff. Marty gets the girl and the truck.)
