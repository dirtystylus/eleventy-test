I’ve had the Kino Lorber 4K release for several months now, and I finally got to watch this—just a movie where all the elements come together in a satisfying way. So much humor and charm, and such a stacked cast.

I haven’t watched this movie all that much—I realize I have large sections of dialogue more due to listening to the David Holmes soundtrack.
