I remember watching this in the theater, I remember the puzzled reception from audiences, I remember the _Solar Ass_ jokes. I also remember liking it, even if I couldn’t put my finger on why. Rewatching it now, I’m struck with how much Soderbergh flirts with big existential themes but ultimately focuses on matters closer to the heart: love and regret. It certainly hits much harder in my middle age.

Interesting watching this cast decades after release—Clooney doesn’t act much anymore, Viola Davis went from supporting roles like this to become a decorated, above-the-title force. Great move to cast Natascha McElhone, her features (those eyes, especially) have always had an otherworldly feel to them. Jeremy Davies didn’t even annoy me this time around.
