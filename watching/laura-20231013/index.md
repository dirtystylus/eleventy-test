Really, really enjoyable—I had meant to watch this shortly after viewing _Leave Her to Heaven_, but it kept popping in and out of my streaming services.

Anyway. Gene Tierney! Of _course_ everyone around Laura Hunt feels possessive about her. I really like how she actively refuses to be hemmed in. Clifton Webb’s Waldo Lydecker (what a great name) gets all the best lines, the kind of scathing, queer-coded character that just jumps off the screen.

This didn’t strike me as a by-the-book film noir (Laura Hunt isn’t really a femme fatale so much as a smart, beautiful woman upon whom others project their desires). The romantic aspect feels half-baked but you know what—I’ll buy it, because again: Gene Tierney.
