A Cinderella story that leans heavily on _The Devil Wears Prada_, which is itself a Cinderella story…the movie doesn’t question the relationship art has to extreme wealth, instead using it as the engine to uplift our heroine. I guess that’s the same thing as Cinderella and the monarchy.

Have I reached the age where I’m mostly watching for the supporting actors who are closer to my age? Marisa Tomei, Lena Olin, and Anthony Head are having fun here. I did as well, even if the familiarity meant the stakes never felt very high.
