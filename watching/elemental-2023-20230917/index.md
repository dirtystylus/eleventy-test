Nice to hear Leah Lewis as Ember. Between this and _Turning Red_, Disney/Pixar going hard on the multigenerational immigrant guilt. I thought there were some big themes here—immigration, caste systems, redlining, interracial dating…whew. I’m not sure that it all comes together! My kids said they enjoyed it, but they talked more about the character design and animation instead of the story.
