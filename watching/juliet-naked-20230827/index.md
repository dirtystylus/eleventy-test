Kept feeling like there were a few too many interesting threads and the filmmakers weren’t quite sure which ones to really commit to, but overall I enjoyed this. Was genuinely nervous when Ethan Hawke’s Tucker Crowe gets up to sing, but the film nails that moment. (Feeling very attacked as someone who had waaaaaay too many strong opinions about music in my teens and twenties. That Tucker Crowe website captures a bit of a very specific era of web 1.0 music fandom.)
