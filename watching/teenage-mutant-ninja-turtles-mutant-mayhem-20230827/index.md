Look, this was made by folks in their 40s so the soundtrack is all the hip-hop I grew up listening to, hard to maintain any sort of critical distance. It looks amazing, and it’s funny, a genuine surprise. Ayo as April is perfect, lots of big names in the cast (Jackie! Holy smokes!) that’ll have you looking up TMDB. National Cinema Day USA!
