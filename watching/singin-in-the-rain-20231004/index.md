I loved this! Of course I’ve seen some of the famous bits in short clips here and there. But it was such a delight to actually watch the whole thing and appreciate its nesting-doll structure and moments of dreamlike digression—particularly that second Cyd Charisse number with her impossibly long veil (scarf?).

\[Why does nobody talk about the brief yet unfortunate blackface that pops up in that one soundstage scene, though? Thankfully it was over quickly.\]

This looked eye-poppingly good in 4K on HBO.
