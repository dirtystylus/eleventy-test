Lots to like here, and even though thereâ€™s no huge surprises the way it gradually winds the tension tighter and tighter is extremely pleasurable. The setting is so economical I wondered if this started out as a play. Well-executed all the way through. Rylance is great in his role; so much bubbling under the surface of his tailor (sorry, _cutter_!).
