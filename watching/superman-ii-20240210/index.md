I vividly remember this movie from watching it on Betamax as a kid. This time it felt pretty uneven, possibly due to the goofy effects. The movie also takes a lot of liberties with the extent and nature of Superman’s (and Zod/Ursa/Non’s) powers, in a way that feels like a cheat at times.

The parts that worked for me were similar to the first, especially the physicality and humor that Christopher Reeve brings to the role (love whenever he “transforms” into Clark or Superman just through altering his posture and affect) and the relationship between Clark and Lois.

(Sometimes I felt like Reeve’s Clark Kent voice was him doing a Kermit the Frog impression. Tell me I’m wrong.)
