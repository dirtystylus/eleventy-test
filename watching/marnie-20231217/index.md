First time watching this. It’s always wild seeing Hitchcock wrestle with his misogyny on film, but this feels like another level. Lots of folks have pointed out how Hitchcock sympathizes with Connery’s Rutland, which is probably why his character is portrayed as a hero even as his actions are simply terrifying. It’s so dissonant.

I thought Hedren was great in this, even though I was often distracted because her voice reminds me a lot of Liza Weil as Paris in Gilmore Girls.

Diane Baker’s Lil Mainwaring…just an agent of pure chaos.
