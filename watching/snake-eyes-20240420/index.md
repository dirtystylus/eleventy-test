A true De Palma starter kit of a film: sinuous tracking shot, deep conspiracy, beautiful woman in costume, camera footage alternately revealing/obscuring the truth.

Cage is operatic in a way that fits his character but also pushes the viewer to exhaustion, he could be a cousin to Sandler’s Howard Ratner from _Uncut Gems_. Carla Gugino…every time I see her onscreen, I get angry all over again that ABC canceled _Karen Sisco_.

I’d seen this before but forgot the “Palestinian terrorist” scapegoat. It shouldn’t surprise me—De Palma has always been clear-eyed about how the state manufactures its public rationale for authoritarian action. I think he’d have plenty to say about our current moment, except he’s already done that in film after film.
