Not sure what accent Sam Rockwell was doing here. Fun, and felt like a stage play within a stage play (some Wes Anderson vibes here in how it’s shot and also having folks like Saoirse Ronan and Adrien Brody). Daniel Pemberton (Spider-Verse) did the music. A bit slight but I’d still happily watch a bunch of these.
