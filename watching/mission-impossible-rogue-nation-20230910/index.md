Got this on 4K UHD disc, so had to give it another spin. I really like how this film _looks_, relative to _Fallout_ and _Dead Reckoning_.

More and more I feel like Ilsa should have been a one-film character—McQuarrie and Cruise seem to have been at a loss for what do do with her character after this dynamite introduction. I guess we’ll always have Vienna/Morocco/London.
