I’m only partly kidding when I say this is Céline Sciamma’s _My Neighbor Totoro:_ the missing parent, the porous boundary between reality and magic, the way kid logic reigns. So economical and spare, but there were at least three times I held my breath because I found it so emotionally affecting. I’ve enjoyed every Sciamma film I’ve seen (I think _Tomboy_ is the only one I haven’t seen).
