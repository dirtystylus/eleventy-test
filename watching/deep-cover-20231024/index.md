Laurence Fishburne keeps things grounded even as other folks in the cast chew scenery and play _BIG_. Even when the story veers to the fantastical Fishburne’s cool, quiet performance makes you ok with the ride. (I think the scene in the limo is the only exception, where things get goofy because everyone’s amping up the volume on their performance.)
