Wish I could’ve seen this one in the theaters. Thought about _Brick_ and (especially) _The Brothers Bloom_ with this one—Johnson loves to simultaneously play within a genre while simultaneously pushing at its limits. One of _Bloom_’s themes is the con built into performance, and movies—a whodunit provides a fun playground to do that. I’ve had a lot of fun between this, _See How They Run_, and tv’s _Bad Sisters_ all using the whodunit in different ways. 

The El\*n jokes have been paid off in full by the events at Twitter over the last \[checks notes\] 2 (!) months. The cameos were fun but honestly it was the _Magnolia_ gag that did it for me.

Also the movie looks great, kudos to the people who know how to light/shoot/edit these days.
