I’ve seen this before and remember a few scenes (J called SJP’s breakfast overture Chekhov’s strata). Rachel McAdams’ screen presence really stands out in a crowded cast—you’re supposed to find her petty and annoying but she has so much charisma that I wanted to watch an alternate movie centered on her and Paul Schneider. (This reminds me that it’s time to rewatch _All the Real Girls_.)
