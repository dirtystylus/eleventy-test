This movie is so goofy, with all the pauses for the Ahnuld one-liners. I always appreciate Verhoevenâ€™s subversive commentary underneath the action and gore. Was Sharon Stone already a big star at this point? (I know Basic Instinct was just a few years later, and that launched her into the stratosphere.) Got bored towards the end.
