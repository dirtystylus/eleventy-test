_This review may contain spoilers._

So bright and colorful yet tinged with sadness and regret everywhere. People are just a minute too early, or too late. And yet there is still a faint hope that lovers will finally connect in the end.

I did not know that Gene Kelly was going to show up, and what a pleasant surprise that turned out to be. It was interesting to see the contrast of his more classic choreography against the other numbers in the film. I’ve only started watching his movies in the last two years and it was like seeing an old friend.

The murder subplot is wild! It’s almost like a parody that the show _Schmigadoon_ would have done.
