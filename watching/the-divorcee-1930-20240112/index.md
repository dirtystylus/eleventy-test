Felt simultaneously ahead of its time and beholden to it—I loved how it depicted Norma Shearer’s Jerry as a smart, complicated woman who gets into and out of marriage for clear reasons. But the ending is a bit of a letdown—like many pre-Code movies this one flirts with boundaries in many places but also reinforces norms on a broader scale. In another world Jerry would just…keep having fun, like she does two-thirds through the movie. First time seeing Norma Shearer onscreen, really enjoyed her performance.
