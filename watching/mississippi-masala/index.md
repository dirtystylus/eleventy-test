First time watching this. Sarita Choudhury and Denzel! \[fans self\] I’ll have to watch this again with the commentary track, there were some plotlines that felt like they were going to be a big deal but weren’t. 

Sometimes the scenes felt a bit stage-y, but most felt so tactile, so effortless, so real. Some melt the screen.

So much good stuff about what makes a home, and family. Also how racial solidarity has its limits in the face of hardened race/caste/group identity.
