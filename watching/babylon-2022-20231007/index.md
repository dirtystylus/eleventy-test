Watched this over the course of three nights. It helps that I had just seen _Singin’ in the Rain_, so a lot of the references and themes felt familiar. There is a \*lot\* going on here—is it weird to say that I wish it were longer, if only to give more time for Sidney’s storyline to properly simmer, or Manny’s rise to truly register? (There’s probably a bunch of cutting-room material about Ruth as well.) I feel like I got too much of Brad Pitt’s Jack Conrad instead. Tobey Maguire helps a lot in the last act, transforming things into a really dark fairy tale—“It’s one more floor down!”. (I also had flashbacks to his scene in Wonder Boys where he’s singing “Good Mornin’”, which of course was also used in _Singin’ in the Rain_.)
