Watched this in bits and pieces over the course of a couple of weeks. Still not my favorite—but I think the installment approach allowed me to appreciate each of the set pieces without feeling the utter exhaustion I experienced the first time I watched it.

I’m mostly bothered by how the film _looks_: lots of shots look like they were shot with Apple’s Smart HDR™, looking oddly flat. Would love to see a return to dramatic shadows/lighting, especially in a spy film. I guess I’ll just throw on _The Night of the Hunter_ again to let my eyes reset.
