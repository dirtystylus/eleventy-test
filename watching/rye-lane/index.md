Charming, effortless. A+ dad joke/food pun/cameo that I won’t spoil. Took me a second to recognize Gus from _Industry_ as Dom. 

I, too, could understand needing to break into an ex’s place (flat? gaff?) to retrieve a copy of _The Low End Theory_.

Raine Allen-Miller uses a lot of wide angle, I was reminded of _No Sudden Move_’s Bubble Vision™ when Vivian Oparah and David Jonsson are moving through the frame.
