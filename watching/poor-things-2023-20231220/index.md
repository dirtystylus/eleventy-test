Don’t have much to add that hasn’t been [said](https://letterboxd.com/moviesmovington/film/poor-things-2023/) [elsewhere](https://letterboxd.com/falisifr/film/poor-things-2023/) except: maybe Yorgos just isn’t my guy. I found the fisheye framing of the early segments and the atonal score quite grating aesthetically, and the sociopolitical commentary basically ends once the jokes they set up were done. But maybe that makes it the perfect bourgeois liberal movie—gesturing vaguely at sexuality, misogyny, poverty, and racism without really interrogating any of it.

Everyone in the cast is game, though, and I enjoyed watching them onscreen when the camera settled down and you got the the beautiful costumes against the colorful, otherworldly backdrops.

Would make for an interesting combo with _Barbie_, and maybe Lena Dunham’s _Sharp Stick_.
