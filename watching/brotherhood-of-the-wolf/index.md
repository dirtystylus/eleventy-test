_This review may contain spoilers._

Haven’t seen this since it originally came out in theaters, but I picked up the new 4K edition and it’s just as wild a stew as I remembered: martial arts action, creature horror, political/religious intrigue, romance. Christophe Gans fading from Monica Bellucci’s curves to snowy hills? this-is-cinema dot jpg

Felt like the right moment to revisit this with Mark Dacascos popping up in Warrior S3 and the John Wick series (though I haven’t seen JW 3). Justice for Mani! In a different world this would be _his_ story. (I don’t understand why he would be repeatedly distracted by Virginie Darmon’s feral woman, feels like I’m missing something.)
