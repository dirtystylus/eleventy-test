Park Ji-min—what a film debut. Her Freddie is a seething ball of chaos, and I love how she is so carefree on one hand, and so closed off and guarded elsewhere. Her extended solo dance scene early on is so random and cathartic (I think the music is great throughout the movie as a companion to Freddie’s journey).

The formal narrative resets are notable for who is missing from Freddie’s life after those years have passed, and who remains. Couldn’t help thinking of Celine Song’s _Past Lives_, a title that could easily have worked for this film as well.
