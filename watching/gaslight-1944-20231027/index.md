This movie works for many reasons but the most powerful one is that you simply cannot stand anyone who would dare treat Ingrid Bergman this way! Charles Boyer is someone I’ve enjoyed onscreen in movies like _Cluny Brown_ and _History is Made at Night_ but his turn here is truly diabolical.

Angela Lansbury’s character feels like it could have gone darker in pre-Code days. There are hints of this but the film doesn’t develop that possibility.

I love what Bergman does in the finale. (For a second I thought I was in for a very different type of ending.)
