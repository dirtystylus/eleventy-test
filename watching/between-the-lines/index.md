Lots of recognizable faces in this one: Jill Eikenberry, Lindsay Crouse, John Heard, Jeff Goldblum. Bruno Kirby! Captures a particular moment in local journalism which pointed to its decline (and now, in 2023, near extinction) at the hands of capitalism and greed. Been meaning to watch this for a while but Iâ€™m glad I finally did it on the heels of Labor Day. RIP Joan Micklin Silver.
