Watched this in three installments, but for a movie with this runtime I was rarely conscious of its length. I may have gasped aloud when the opening gave way to the credits, bold move. The sound design within the car’s cocoon as they move through tunnels and different weather, the cigarette shot for the Tumblr crowd…all that somehow organic, not showy. 

I liked Hamaguchi’s _Asako I & II_ a lot; I may like this one better if only because I’m in middle life and at this point the questions left unasked, and the things unsaid, have accrued true weight.
