Took the time to watch the bonus material for this, and then rewatched the film. If my first viewing of this overwhelmed my eyeballs, the familiarity this time allowed me to soak in the details and how much care went into the character designs/animation styles for the different spider-people.

I hear the folks who say that this movie doesn’t quite stand on its own, narratively. It felt at times like an overstuffed tv episode—tune in next week! It reminded me of this [NY Times piece](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/03/14/opinion/pop-music-songwriting.html) on how the structure of modern pop music has changed, especially with the ascendancy of the hook. This film feels like that—hook after hook, as opposed to more of a classic story arc. I don’t mind it, but maybe that’s because it feels akin to the rhythm of a comic issue? (With a much longer wait, unfortunately.)

My first viewing of the film was in a small theater with a washed out picture, the 4K disc really put that to shame even on a smaller screen.
