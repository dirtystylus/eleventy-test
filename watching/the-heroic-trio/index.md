This isn’t my usual lane but I had a lot of fun with this one—it feels like a comic book in the best sense, and really makes me wish that modern superhero films didn’t take themselves so seriously. Michelle Yeoh, Anita Mui, and Maggie Cheung are all compelling in their own way. There are some choices here! (I’m thinking of the babies in peril in particular). The action is silly and kinetic and over-the-top and so much fun.
