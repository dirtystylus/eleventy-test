I, too, would ruin myself for KST’s Katharine Clifton. That this movie also features Ralph Fiennes, Naveen Andrews, and Juliette Binoche, all converging at some higher plane of peak hotness…I’m sorry, where was I?

Sometimes you finally watch a movie that came up big at the Oscars and it doesn’t hold up, but this hit for me: structure, visuals, score, performances…honestly wish films had even a fraction of the ambition and execution in this one. I can see how watching this in one sitting might turn some folks off—I watched it over three nights, roughly an hour each time, like a homebrew miniseries.
