It’s not _not_ about making movies

I mean, the whole structure is literal location shoots! Is this Fincher’s existential wrestling with being a filmmaker in this age? The obsessive attention to preparation and detail—the character is basically Fincher, right? Is The Client a stand in for the studio system that’s driven him to streaming? Are all the WeWork/Amazon/brand jokes just a reflection on what goes into moviemaking now?

I watched this after _Heat_ and just like that movie the guy should just let go but he simply can’t, he constantly repeats his code but breaks it anyway. Tilda/Fassbender is your De Niro/Pacino coffee break. Speaking of Tilda, this could make an interesting pairing with _Michael Clayton_.
