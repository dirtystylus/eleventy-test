Always charmed by how Italians say “okay.”

I love the sequences of Amanda walking, they distort space and time through the jump cuts. (Contrast that to the final, unbroken shot.)

Trying to put my finger on what this reminded me of: _Lady Bird_, certainly, as many others have mentioned on here. Maybe _Rushmore_, in character/vibe?

I think I saw Giovanna Mezzogiorno in a film twenty years ago, nice to see her pop up here.
