I saw this in the theater when it came out and I remember being confused by its pacing and the philosophical bent of the ending.

At times this feels like an odd fit for De Palma: it doesn’t feel scuzzy and twisted enough. But on the other hand: his signature gliding camerawork and long takes feel like a natural fit for zero-G, and you can see his love of romance and tragedy throughout the film. I feel some echoes of this film in more recent space-set dramas like _For All Mankind_ and _Interstellar_. 

Can’t believe it’s been almost two years since we lost Ennio Morricone.
