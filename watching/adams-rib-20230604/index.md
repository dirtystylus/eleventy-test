First time watching this! Love Hepburn/Holliday here. The scene where they meet and Holliday narrates the events leading up to her arrest is both funny and relatable:

“And…after you shot him, how did you feel then?”

“Hungry.”

Wish the ending didn’t dilute the punch of the more feminist argument that precedes it.

Never been a big Spencer Tracy fan and this doesn’t change my mind. Tracy’s Adam Bonner _definitely_ believes in the meritocracy.
