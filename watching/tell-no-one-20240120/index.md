Shades of _The Fugitive_, but with a bit too many plot threads—the tension occasionally leaks out because the script doesn’t know when to be explicit and when to layer misdirection. It’s best during the extended chase midway through, which was genuinely thrilling, despite the unexpectedly relaxed score. 

A lot of exposition in the final act, and I kept wondering what a master like De Palma would have done with the space between what characters say, and what the camera shows.

Love whenever Kristin Scott Thomas show up onscreen, but especially when it’s in a French production.
