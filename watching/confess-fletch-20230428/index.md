“Five stars!”

“Flesssh…”

Jon Hamm on a scooter through Italian streets, what an aspirational moment. Fun to see him and Slattery share the screen again.  Marcia Gay Harden and Annie Mumolo, just two chaotic ladies. 

The Griz/Inspector Monroe reminded me of _See How They Run_. Like that movie, I could easily go for another round.
