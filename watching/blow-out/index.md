I _think_ I’ve seen _Blow Out_ before, long enough ago to have forgotten the specifics but not the sense of overwhelming dread. Went from seeing Nancy Allen in a small role in _Out of Sight_ to her starring role in this.

I love the way De Palma continually features scenes in his movies that show of the work of making movies, as if to say: I’m showing you how it’s done, but if I do my job well enough you’re still going to suspend your disbelief and be swept away. The scenes that bookend the film, the scenes where Jack slowly pieces together a version of what happened—it’s all tinged with a mix of wonder and cynicism.

Also: Philly!
