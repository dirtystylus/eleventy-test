First 2/3rds are great—just absolutely goofy, and directly acknowledges the audience’s desire to watch Cruise die dozens of different ways. I find Cruise better when he embraces the ridiculousness of his intense persona, and he leans way in here. Emily Blunt’s traps are doing a lot of character work here! I forgot how well she does the action hero thing.

If I have a criticism it’s that the conclusion feels a bit rote, especially coming after the wit of the first third, and the helicopter/barn scenes that do a great job of showing the weariness and despair that the loops have brought to Crui—sorry, Cage.
