I thought I had seen this but maybe I got it confused with _Road to Perdition_? Lots of familiar Mann characters and themes—the chaotic member of the crew who ruins the clean execution of a heist, the intense romance even as time and luck run out. (Well, in Mann’s Cinematic Universe those are the same thing.)

It’s really interesting to see how Dillinger and his associates captivate the national imagination and the feds’ obsession, even as new tech quickly makes the irrelevant. They’re the last to know the jig is up. And just like almost every Mann film, they simply cannot walk away.
