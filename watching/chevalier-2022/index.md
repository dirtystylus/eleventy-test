The opening scene is so electric (and I mean that almost literally, the violin duel feels more like an electric guitar showdown) that it’s hard for the rest of the movie to match its intensity. But overall I liked this, even if it felt like it left a _lot_ of Joseph Bolgne’s life on the table. Kelvin Harrison Jr. and Samara Weaving, take a bow.
