I’ve seen this before but remembered nothing. It certainly hits differently now that I’m a middle-aged man who has to regularly content with the decisions (big and small) that I made as a younger person. I liked the band of misfits that make up Martin Bishop & Associates. I was also tickled by the fact that their climactic heist (involving biometric access control/motion/temperature sensors) presaged Mission: Impossible’s more stylish and iconic rendition four years later.
