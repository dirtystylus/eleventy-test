Makes me long for a return to telling stories visually. The camera (or sometimes, camera-within-the-camera) shows us what we need to know. How this movie accomplishes so much with just two main locations is a wonder. 

Philadelphia’s own Grace Kelly! What a screen presence. Jimmy Stewart deserved an Oscar for being halfway convincing that Jeff would say no to Lisa.
