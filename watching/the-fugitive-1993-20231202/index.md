_This review may contain spoilers._

There’s a section when Kimball returns to Chicago and he’s boarding a subway car with a sign for Kimball station, then it cuts to a helicopter shot of downtown with a skyscraper that has a giant “Harrison” sign. Cinema!

I’d forgotten about how the Chicago PD and big pharma come off in this movie, like it’s about a man on the run but it’s also about police railroading a guy onto death row and shady medical trials.

Watched this on the new 4K disc release and it looks great, good job Warner Bros.
