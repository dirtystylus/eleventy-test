Paired this with _Emily the Criminal_ for a Sunday afternoon late-capitalism double bill.

Ridiculous but it’s good to see J Law turn on the charm and have fun. About half an hour too long, and never really seems interested in using humor to grapple with the reasons the deck is stacked against Maddie. It kind of waves at those themes but backs away. It could’ve used some of the rage coursing through _Emily,_ channeled through humor. But maybe I’m asking for too much.
