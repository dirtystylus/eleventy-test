Towards the end I kept thinking, this feels like Blow Out meets Panic Room, and then I saw David Koepp’s name in the end credits. I enjoyed this, and I really love Soderbergh’s continual explorations of form—somehow he keeps pushing himself instead of calcifying into a specific style. Bonus points for the 90s-era music, I was transported back to flipping through my CD binder at Vassar.
