Watched this with the kids—we’d all read the graphic novel at one point or another, although it’s no longer fresh in my head so I’m not sure what changed with the adaptation. I do think that the movie had a tough job to navigate the tonal shift from chaotic slapstick to the more emotional ending, and I’m not sure it fully succeeded.
