Extremely my kind of thing. I’m quite impressed—it’s a remix of some very familiar forms: noir and romantic comedy, with a splash of melodrama. Park Chan-wook is having a lot of fun taking the techniques of folks like Hitchcock and De Palma and deploying them in his own way. If it sometimes comes off as a technical exercise with tension that feels a bit _too_ controlled, I loved it nonetheless—and the ending is really quite something.
