I’m a casual tennis fan and at times my body started responding physiologically to the “matches” onscreen—holding my breath during rallies, palms slightly sweaty.

All three leads are great (hi Kristen Scott Thomas, being super French). Even though tennis is the frame, it’s not really about the game. I thought a lot about heist films and their one-last-score setup. You’re rooting for Thomas to win, mostly because it’s a shot at walking away (literally and figuratively) in peace.
