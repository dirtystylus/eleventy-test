Beautiful, and fascinating to watch given that the Jolie/Pitt marriage is now over. MÃ©lanie Laurent is in this, would have watched this sooner had I known. The last third feels messy, resolving the tension that builds up between the two couples in a way that feels quite rushed and also a touch too literal and predictable.
