First time watching this—I did it over the course of three days. What a cast, so many recognizable faces. Did not expect this movie to connect the post-9/11 moment so clearly to what’s happening in Gaza…but it did, and through scenes that were simultaneously hilarious and sad. The classroom scenes, my god.

This story would have turned out very differently if the friends and adults around Lisa had cared enough to really listen to her. Also therapy! That could have helped. She’s so traumatized and has no way to process what she’s experienced.
