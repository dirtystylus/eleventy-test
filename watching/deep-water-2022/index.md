I really wish this movie embraced the black humor inherent to the story. I feel like Affleck gets it, with his “Great. I gotta kill another guy?” weariness. Ana De Armas is a great screen presence but I feel like her character is very underwritten. I wanted a little bit more of her motivations—is she in on the whole thing? Because _that_ would be interesting.
