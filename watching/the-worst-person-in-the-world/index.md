I liked this a lot, will definitely have to watch again to see if it holds up. We get away from Julieâ€™s story towards the end, it feels like the movie straining against its original intent. Reinsve is amazing in this, I hope she experiences a Vicky Krieps-like catapult into whatever roles she wants.
