You invite the wrong guy to the group chat and look what happens

Truly a film where everyone knows the right thing to do is to walk away, to actually do what their code tells them to do, and they simply. cannot. do. it.

I love this movie but it’s probably been over a decade since I watched it? You can see in the LA nightscapes what Mann would later do with DV in _Collateral_ and _Miami Vice_—there’s a scene with Neil and Eady against the city lights that looks like greenscreen because how else would you get both foreground and background in focus with no light?

Drink every time someone says “time is luck” in a Michael Mann film.
