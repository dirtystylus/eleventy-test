When Vine…uh, existed, I wondered how many of its stars would actually get to make a feature film, and here we have one! Could have used a tighter edit at the script stage—it feels like there’s one too many story threads competing for screen time, and I felt the running time towards the final third. For better or worse reminded me of _In the Heights_ and _Tick, Tick…Boom!_.
