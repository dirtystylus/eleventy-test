It’s been a while since I’ve watched this (it’s not on the streamers I subscribe to, and I missed its return to theaters last year). I got the new steelbook release (sadly no 4K upgrade in the cards). It mostly holds up for me—if its twee vibes annoyed you then, that probably won’t change now. Wild to see a very opinionated visual look like this in today’s era of homogenous streaming aesthetics.
