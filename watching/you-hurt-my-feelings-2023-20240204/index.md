I was worried this would be too cringey for me, but I shouldn’t have doubted Holofcener (TIL I learned it is _not_ Holofcenter, as I’ve thought for decades). Every character in this is ridiculous at some level, but you’re rooting for them to grow nonetheless. Lots of fun familiar faces in the therapy scenes.
