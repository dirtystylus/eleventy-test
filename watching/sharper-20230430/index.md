I’m a big fan of con/heist movies and this one relies a _lot_ on scenarios that we’ve seen many times before. I dunno. Sometimes the familiarity can be comforting.

It’s always nice to see Julianne Moore onscreen (nice meta moment there with her talking about being sick of playing the wife). It says something that you’re rooting for her even when the movie probably doesn’t want you to. 

I was a little put off by how _ugly_ this movie looked: the production design is great but the color grading is that muddy sludge that we can’t seem to get away from.

I appreciated the Vassar reference though.
