Fun! Everything feels like it’s running on rails, but the cast is charming (RIP Carmen Salinas), and I like that it’s concerned with a broader look at friendship and family instead of a standard fake-thing-turns-real plot. 

I remember liking the original, I’ll have to rewatch it to see how differently it plays.
