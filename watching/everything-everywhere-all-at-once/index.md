Whew. What an appropriate title. I laughed through so much of this but also felt like it needed a good edit at the story level—it’s overly long and some of the ideas were probably better left out of the final result. Still, I’m always down for Wong Kar Wai cosplay and riffs on films like _The Matrix_ with an absurdist slant. I can’t believe some of these scenes got filmed!
