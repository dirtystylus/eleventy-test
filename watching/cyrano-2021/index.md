Not everything works here, but I really enjoyed it. The National is not a band I would have thought of for a musical, and some of the songs don’t give the performers the best material to work with (loved that little musical interlude before the charge, though). I forgot Bennett can really sing, despite having rewatched Music and Lyrics last year. Dinklage’s expressive face! Someone that handsome and witty and adept with a sword would have had lots of romantic success, you gotta suspend your disbelief on that front. Kelvin Harrison Jr.’s Christian brings the right mix of innocence and humor, that character could have easily been a bore.
