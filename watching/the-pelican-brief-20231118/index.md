I think I was pretty meh on this when it first came out, but I thoroughly enjoyed it this time. Made me want to rewatch _Michael Clayton_. And _Erin Brockovich_. 

Remember when politicians had a measure of shame? When you had to resort to murder instead of just, y’know, bribing Supreme Court justices?

Denzel and Julia’s characters: all that charisma, those megawatt smiles, all while solving crimes together?  They totally had a thing, let’s be real now.

This movie would not work in the cellphone era.
