I really don’t go in for horror but after watching Decision to Leave it felt appropriate to finally rent this one, staying with the themes of voyeurism/surveillance and the slippery balance between the watcher and the watched. Maika Monroe is very good as Julie, and I really like how Chloe Okuno makes us feel Julie’s sense of disorientation through how she’s shot (and especially with the un-subtitled Romanian dialogue that hurtles by too fast for her to understand). Not too many jump scares (which is fine by me), but lots of slow-moving, sustained dread. Probably going to rewatch soon just to catch all of the detail that went into the cinematography/costuming/editing.
