One of the final set of discs that Netflix sent to me. I enjoyed this ok, even if I’m not sure what it all adds up to…I’ll take any excuse to watch Michelle Pfeiffer onscreen. I like what she did with the character’s gradual transformation, even if her key motivation remained opaque for me throughout. But it almost doesn’t matter, because there’s a moment late in the screen where she’s lit so beautifully and…well. Movie stars.
