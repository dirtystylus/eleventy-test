Hi, I’m Mark. I’m a developer and writer currently living just outside Philadelphia, PA. I’ve been building things for the web for over 22 years, and I particularly love the intersection of content strategy, design, and implementation. This site houses my [blog posts](/posts/) and also my [reading log](/reading/).

At work I’m the Head of Technology for [Bluecadet](https://bluecadet.com), where we build experiences in online and physical spaces.

Thanks for being here.
