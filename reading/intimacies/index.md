Picked this up at the library over the weekend, and I saw that it was just included on the [2021 National Book Award longlist](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/17/books/national-book-awards-2021-longlist.html?action=click&module=Well&pgtype=Homepage&section=Books). Definitely made me think of Brandon Taylor’s recent [“bobos in ikea”](https://blgtylr.substack.com/p/bobos-in-ikea) essay from his *Sweater Weather* newsletter,[^1] which crystallized some of the stylistic trends in contemporary fiction for me. I wouldn’t be surprised if a movie adaptation is already in the works.

[^1]: Brandon Taylor contributed a blurb for the book, which doubled the resonance.
