Several friends had recommended Rosemary Kirstein’s *Steerswoman* series, and I was surprised to find out that this first book was originally published in 1989. The story focuses on Rowan, member of an order of steerswomen who travel the world and gather/exchange information. They’re basically researchers and cartographers, and the story brings them into a mysterious conflict with the magicians of their world. It’s a great mix of characters, world-building, and adventure. I can’t wait to get started on the next volume.
