It took me a while to find a physical copy of this—I eventually just placed an order at my [local bookshop](http://www.narberthbookshop.com) and they hand-delivered it to my stoop. While I read it I thought a lot about how my mother has been passing on a lot of our family’s food traditions to my eldest—I feel both pride and joy at their connection but it also feels like my mom skipped over me.
