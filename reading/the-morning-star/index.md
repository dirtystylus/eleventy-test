I’d never read any of Knausgaard’s books before, and frankly I’m still not sure what to expect if I read another one. I found *The Morning Star* to be dark and ambiguous—I liked how the loosely-related stories felt like they were slipping further from reality, into the realm of dreams (and possibly satire?). The ending feels like a stunt but it…works? Probably going to need a reread in the future.
