The end of the line for a series that seemed like such a one-liner: *couple discovers they can freeze time when they have sex, decide to rob banks*. Yet Fraction and Zdarsky created something deeper that spoke to trauma, shame, depression, relationships, and yesâ€”sex. Sometimes they dealt with those themes with gentleness, and sometimes with broad humor. The conclusion is much sadder than I expected, but it feels appropriate.
