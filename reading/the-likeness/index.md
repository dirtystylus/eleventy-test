*In the Woods* messed me up so badly it took me two years to give Tana French’s Dublin Murder Squad series another go. I like French’s writing—it’s genre fiction that pauses for breath instead of just hurtling through plot. 

If *Woods* was an exercise in withholding catharsis, *The Likeness* feels more straightforward—at times French seems to be explicitly reminding the reader that the central mystery is just a device to unearth the true conflict happening within Detective Cassie Maddox. I had braced myself for something similarly bleak as *Woods*; when the ending came I let out a long breath of relief.
