Brandon Taylor has tweeted about Rachel Cusk’s *Outline* trilogy so often that I figured I’d dive in. Feels appropriate to read this right after [*Whereabouts*](/reading/whereabouts)—both books feel only tangentially concerned with plot, and the chapters often feel like standalone vignettes. I’ll be continuing on to the other books in the series.
