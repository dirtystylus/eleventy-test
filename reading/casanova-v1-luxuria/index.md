Reading the [recent Daredevil](/reading/daredevil-know-fear-v1/) reminded me to look up what Matt Fraction has been up to lately, but instead of new stuff I dug into his older *Casanova* series. The themes are familiar: spies and secret agencies, time travel, sex, and family—but Fraction approaches them with the subversive humor that readers will recognize from his work on *Hawkeye* and *Sex Criminals*. The art by Gabriel Bá reminds me a lot of Mike Mignola’s work.
