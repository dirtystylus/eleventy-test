My introduction to Connie Willis’ loosely-connected Oxford Time Travel series was via [*To Say Nothing of the Dog*](/reading/to-say-nothing-of-the-dog/). If that novel went heavy on the comedy, *Blackout* (part of duology with *All Clear*[^1]) is decidedly more serious. It follows three historians (Merope Ward, Polly Churchill, and Michael Davies), all on different assignments during WWII, who find themselves stranded in the past. I particularly loved how Willis gradually shifted the tone: the historians’ feeling of academic remove and control gradually gets overrun—first by dread, and then panic, as they realize that they may have no way of getting home.

[^1]: Apparently Willis realized midway through that she was writing more than one book (not unlike Tamsyn Muir with her Locked Tomb trilogy-turned-tetralogy). After tearing through *Blackout* I hurried off to the library to pick up *All Clear* and laughed when I saw that it weighed in at over 600 pages.
