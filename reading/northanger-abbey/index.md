Dove back into Austen after hearing that my niece has gotten into the classics. Northanger Abbey isn’t one of the Austen books that gets repeatedly adapted to film/tv, but I enjoyed it a lot. It’s very referential—about writing and novels and how books work on their readers. Austen’s usual observations on class and womanhood are still very present, helped along by Austen explicitly positioning Catherine Morland as young and naive in the beginning of the novel.
