This is *Halt and Catch Fire* Cam/Donna fanfic, right?

I kid. I liked this a lot, although there was a moment when I was reminded of Hanya Yanagihara’s *A Little Life*, a book that I disliked intensely.

The book sometimes felt like it was rushing—there are some interesting threads that lay the groundwork for a key conflict later in the book, but they feel a bit underdeveloped so the conflict feels a bit silly and contrived. (Then again, conflicts in one’s 20s and 30s often hinge on silly circumstances and misunderstandings.)

Top notch cover art, by the way. I was out reading this and got lots of inquiries.
