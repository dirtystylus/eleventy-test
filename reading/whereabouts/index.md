Read this over the course of a day. Reminded me a lot of Katie Kitamura’s [*Intimacies*](/reading/intimacies), even though they’re quite different. I’m very intrigued by Lahiri’s process writing this book,[^1] and I did often wonder whether I would pick up deeper layers if I were able to read it in the original Italian.
