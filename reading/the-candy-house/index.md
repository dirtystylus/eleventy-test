I barely remembered *A Visit From the Goon Squad*, whose characters pop up here, but I’m not sure that it mattered in the end. I didn’t expect it to lean into sci-fi territory as much as it did. Overall I enjoyed it, and I actually wish Egan had taken more time with the various threads she was pulling together. There’s a lot of characters, and formal shifts (many of them supporting the humor) but it also felt like a rush, and the characters were exiting the stage almost as soon as they’d been introduced.
