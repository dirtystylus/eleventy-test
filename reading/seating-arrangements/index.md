I wanted to read Shipstead’s *Great Circle* but all the copies were out at the library; read this (Shipstead’s debut novel) instead.

The story centers on a WASP wedding off the coast of Cape Cod. I found it well-written if uneven—there’s multiple characters who get sections/chapters from their PoV but in the end the story rests chiefly on two: Winn and Livia (father and sister of the bride, respectively). Perhaps it would have beeen more biting if Shipstead had written this more recently—I occasionally felt shades of HBO’s *The White Lotus* (there’s a Dominique/Paula parallel that kept popping up in my head). Still very interested in *Great Circle*.
