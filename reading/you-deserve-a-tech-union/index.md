*You Deserve a Tech Union* might feel like a bit of a surprise based on Ethan Marcotte’s previous books published by A Book Apart, but it is really a continuation of his work the last several years documenting and interrogating our broader tech industry: what gets to be considered a tech job, and who gets to be considered a tech worker? What do we owe each other, when tech companies, big and small, are intent on deskilling our work? 

Ethan spends his initial chapters quickly showing how the tech industry, for all its self-generated exceptionalism, is yet another site in the long history of capital exploitation. Fortunately, there’s an equally long lineage of worker solidarity resisting that exploitation to draw on, and that’s why I was so excited about this book. 

A Book Apart bills their mission as publishing focused short books on things and making them “practical and fun”. This book is short to be sure, but it is meticulously researched, structured well and generous. By that I mean two things: One, Ethan sets the the stage with a historical overview and does a nifty balancing act, letting the people who have been organizing and fighting in solidarity for worker’s rights guide the reader through the practical overview and steps for organizing a union and winning recognition. Two, this book shows a commitment to solidarity. When Ethan writes “The machine comes for me, and for thee” it’s shot with the kind of clear-eyed recognition that we can either choose to hoard individual survival, or we can act in solidarity in search of mutual flourishing. I’m glad that this book is out there, and I’m excited to dig deeper now that Ethan has guided us.
