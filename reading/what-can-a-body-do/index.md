I know I was just writing about [how I don’t typically reread books](/posts/mandy-brown-the-case-for-rereading/), but this is one that I will give a second, closer pass. There’s so many powerful, carefully-framed ideas in the book, but the one that I’m sitting with right now is how Sara repeatedly de-emphasizes products in favor of process. For example: when we ask about scale, we tend to focus on output, instead of the methods (collaborative, inclusive) that can get us there.

*What Can a Body Do?* is beautifully written, which is no small thing. I get frustrated with books that are packed with great ideas, save for how to deliver them. *Body* is written as what I can only describe as heady abstractions grounded in flesh and blood. Reading the epilogue—as Sara invoked Maxine Greene’s call to “[think] of things as they could be otherwise”—I was pumping my fist in the air, tears in my eyes.
