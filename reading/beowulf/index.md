*Bro!*

I had read Headley’s *The Mere Wife* in 2019, so I was excited to read her new translation of *Beowulf*. I feel like I benefited from never having read it before—it felt fun, and weird, and a little bit irreverent. It’s short, too—somehow I had thought Beowulf would be lengthy like Homer’s *Odyssey*.
