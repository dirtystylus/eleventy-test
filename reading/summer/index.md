*Summer* wraps up Ali Smith’s seasonal quartet. I didn’t expect the return of characters from the previous three novels; it was a pleasant surprise to find them reappear and intersect without the plot feeling contrived. I found myself wondering how much of this had been planned at the outset of the series, or if those characters simply refused to stay in their place. Regardless: Smith closes the series with one last volume of humanity and hope in an oftentimes bleak world.
