The phrase “slowly, then all at once” could describe the first two books of the series: if [*Too Like the Lightning*](/reading/too-like-the-lightning) spent significant time with world-building and showing the cracks forming in a utopian society, a lot of those cracks give way in this volume. The key players are shuffled around the board, and war is in the air for book three.
