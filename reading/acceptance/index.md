No easy answers, and VanderMeer leaves some (most?) of the mysteries unsolved. What is Area X? Maybe it doesn’t matter in the end. If the first two books focused quite directly on singular characters, this final installment feels more like an ensemble piece. It feels fitting that it should be more about a collective experience *of*—and response *to*—the weirdness the world has come in contact with.
