Rereading this, because [Harrow the Ninth](/reading/harrow-the-ninth) practically demands that you review everything that happens in this first book. I’m filled with even more admiration for how Muir planted the clues and narrative hooks for key characters and events in the series.[^1]

Side note: my friend put me on to [this post from Muir](https://tazmuir.tumblr.com/post/187901634998/hello-i-loved-gideon-the-ninth-so-much-and) a while back, and it’s fascinating to read how Muir pictured the characters in her mind. I like how she acknowledges her particular grounding in place—“I am a Kiwi: I write Kiwis In Space as a default”—and also how she drew from New Zealand’s ethnic groups for her characters.
