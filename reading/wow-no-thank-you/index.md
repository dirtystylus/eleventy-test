I loved Irby’s previous essay collection, *we are never meeting in real life.* *wow, no thank you.* has much of the same humor but also cut more deeply (for me), perhaps because this book is more squarely located in “being 40 and trying to be a functional adult” territory. (The essay “Late-1900s Time Capsule” evokes so much recognition for me, as someone who confused *music I like* with *my personality* during that era.) The rest of the book is great, too; highly recommended.
