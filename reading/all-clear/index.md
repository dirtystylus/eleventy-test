Whew. I really enjoyed the *Blackout* / *All Clear* duology, even if it does feel like Willis could have made a good 600-page single-volume version of this story. Her style can be a bit repetitive in parts—to use a tv analogy, reading both books felt like a 23-episode broadcast tv season as opposed to a 10-ep limited series, with lots of red herrings and mini-cliffhangers sprinkled throughout. That sometimes works, and sometimes it feels like a lot of meandering. I’m glad I stuck around for the ride, because it does build to a good, emotionally resonant payoff.
