Lots of reviews have talked about the thematic links between this and *Never Let Me Go*—there’s a similar slow reveal of the way this speculative world diverges from our present reality, but few specifics. I liked how Klara’s growing understanding of the social and political terrain of her world mirrors the reader’s—we slowly become aware of class stratification, medical interventions, and unease about AI-equipped beings. I found it gentler overall than *Never*, but also less affecting.
