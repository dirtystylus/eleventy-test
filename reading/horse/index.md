Reads like the work of someone who *really* did the reading during the brief moment of racial reckoning in the USA four years ago. I enjoyed the storylines set in the past during Lexingtonâ€™s life more than the ones in the present day. I learned some fun things about horses and racing, and it made me recall the line from Wonder Boys about the [genealogies of the horses](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I8PLjzTzy08), which always makes me laugh.
