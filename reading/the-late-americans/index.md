A set of stories with interlocking characters—lots of meditations on art and what it demands from artists of different kinds, and how those demands are intersect with sex, love, and money. Lots of beautiful, emotionally inarticulate people within these pages—if I sometimes found them frustrating it certainly didn’t diminish my desire to find out what happens to them.
