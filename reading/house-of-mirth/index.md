Justice for Lily Bart! 

Some parts felt incredibly fresh and applicable to modern times.[^1] Other parts—notably the anti-Semitic characterization of Rosedale—not so much. Scorsese called his adaptation of Wharton’s *The Age of Innocence* the most violent film he’s ever made, so I knew a bit of what to expect, but it really did feel like reading a horror film, if that makes any sense.

Other thoughts: I read this alongside Sally Rooney’s [*Beautiful World, Where Are You* ](/reading/beautiful-world-where-are-you) and *Mirth* is *so* different in form. A very clear reliance on plot, and scenes! But on the other hand: a lot of resonance between the two books in how women are constrained by capitalism and the patriarchy.

If you’re looking for an ebook version, I recommend the [Standard Ebooks one](https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/edith-wharton/the-house-of-mirth).
