Another time travel novel; feels like I’ve read a bunch of those this year. I thought of Matt Haig’s [*The Midnight Library*](/reading/the-midnight-library/) while reading this, and I think I liked this one better overall. (It probably helps that *This Time Tomorrow* overflows with loving descriptions of a New York in the time when I lived there after graduating from college.[^1])

I liked that Straub’s time travel conceit is fairly constrained—this isn’t a book that kicks off a globe-and-era-spanning adventure. It’s smaller in scope, and a lot of the key moments happen in the minute shifts Alice and Leonard experience when looping back to the same day repeatedly. It’s a bit similar to *Groundhog Day* in that Alice returns to the same day in the past, trying to escape a trap…except the trap is her present day. Her eventual journey out of that loop didn’t carry a ton of surprise, but it was poignant (and freighted with more emotion than I expected, knowing some of the [real-life story](https://www.vulture.com/article/peter-straub-emma-straub-remembrance-father.html) of Straub and her late father).

[^1]: Before moving to Jersey City, and then Brooklyn, I also lived in West Orange, New Jersey, very close to the Montclair that Alice visits in one scene.
