Didn’t think this would be my kind of thing, despite my love for Towles’ *A Gentleman in Moscow* and *Rules of Civility*. I ended up liking it a lot, though—the jacket flap description had me worried it would be more of a hard-boiled thriller but it turned out to be more funny and gentle than I expected.
