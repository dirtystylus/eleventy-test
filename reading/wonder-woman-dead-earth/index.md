I read this because Anjelica Jade Bastién [told me to](https://tinyletter.com/angelicabastien/letters/what-to-read-instead-of-watching-wonder-woman-1984).[^1] The setup here is one part zombie flick, two parts *Mad Max: Fury Road*. The story feels quite appropriate to our times, when it feels like even superheroes couldn’t save humanity from its worst impulses. I wish DC would put stuff like this onscreen—it nods to the character’s mythology but doesn’t feel burdened by it. Highly recommended.


[^1]: If you’re at all a fan of Wonder Woman, casual or otherwise, the whole entry of Bastién’s newsletter is worth your while.
