I was about to dive into the HBO show but my friend suggested I read the comic first. Some parts definitely show their age—most of the  characters are white, for one, and the political references are standard Cold War-era fare. I’m very curious how the show will (or won’t) address some of those shortcomings.

It’s a nice coincidence that I finished this just before reading [Alan Moore’s recent interview](https://deadline.com/2020/10/alan-moore-rare-interview-watchmen-creator-the-show-superhero-movies-blighted-culture-1234594526/). (Given the contrast between *Watchmen*’s attempts to undercut the superhero mythos, and the emergence of the MCU as the dominant film template of today, I’m not surprised that Moore is done with the genre.)
