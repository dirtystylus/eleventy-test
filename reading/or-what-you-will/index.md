It took me a while to get through this one, and I’m still not sure why. It’s not really long, and there’s a lot of good stuff in here about the act of writing, and much playful formalism around narrators, point of view, and *what’s real anyway*. (It would probably have helped me to review the plot of Twelfth Night.[^1]) The book reminded me quite a bit of [*Piranesi*](/reading/piranesi)—not in any specific way, more a mood or a feeling.

[^1]: I dimly remember seeing it performed at Shakespeare in the Park in the early 00s.
