A fun, quick read after the doorstop that was [*Perhaps the Stars*](/reading/perhaps-the-stars/). I kept expecting this to take a very dark, gory turn (a la *Yellowjackets*) but instead it was really gentle and life-affirming.

I was reading a galley copy so it was funny to see typos, and “TK—allow 2 pages” as the only text for the Acknowledgments page.
