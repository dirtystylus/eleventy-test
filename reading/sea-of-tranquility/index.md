Stretches of the book felt like continuing threads from a talk I heard Emily St. John Mandel give at [Chautauqua in 2015](/posts/chautauqua-2015/#emily-st.-john-mandel), when she was still riding the overwhelming wave of *Station Eleven*. This novel feels like Mandel’s attempt to grapple with the Covid-19 pandemic, as well as her own fame—which [checks notes] came about from writing a novel about a pandemic. And…it works. It also folds [*The Glass Hotel*](/reading/the-glass-hotel/) into a larger Mandelverse, without destroying that book’s core story.

Connie Willis’ *To Say Nothing of the Dog* would make a wonderful, comedic pairing with this one.
