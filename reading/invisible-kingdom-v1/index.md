G. Willow Wilson is dealing with some big themes here: destructive capitalism, political and religious corruption, and civic apathy. We’ve seen the setup before: ragtag group of contract space-freighter misfits save a mysterious person; peril ensues. I’m interested to read Volume 2, if only to see how well the critique of capitalism and religion plays out.
