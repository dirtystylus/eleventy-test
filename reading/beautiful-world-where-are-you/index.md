I enjoyed the epistolary sections a lot; I would read a book of Sally Rooney essays. Feels a bit like the moment when a band starts singing about the price of fame. Write what you know, I guess. It felt less bleak than her first two books. (It might be a better novel than *Normal People*, but I think I prefer *NP*?)
