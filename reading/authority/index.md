I found *Authority*—the second installment of Jeff VanderMeer’s Southern Reach trilogy—a scarier read than [*Annihilation*](/reading/annihilation/). The setting here is the Southern Reach, on the doorstep of Area X. But that setting on our side of the border makes the creeping dread of *Annihilation* feel even more real. We learn a bit more about the various factions pushing their separate agendas with respect to Area X, and we learn a bit more about the history of the expeditions there—including the one we experience in *Annihilation*. Through it all Vandermeer keeps ratcheting up the paranoia. I have the final installment in hand and I am very curious to see how all of this resolves (or doesn’t).
