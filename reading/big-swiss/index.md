Picked this up at the library on a lark, after seeing it in my local bookstore. I read this while working my way through *Sword & Citadel* and a reread of *Jonathan Strange & Mr Norrell*. *Big Swiss* is funny and sexy and also at times felt more like a tv script? Which made a lot of sense later on, when I found out that it’s already been optioned by HBO, with \[checks notes\] Jodie Comer set to star. I’m calling it now, they are going to cast Kathryn Hahn in this as Greta. It feels like her lane.
