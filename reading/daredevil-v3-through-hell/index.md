The Kingpin (aka Wilson Fisk) attempts to do rich-people grifting, Matt Murdock tries to do Daredevil things without putting on the mask again, and Elektra shows up to kick Murdock’s butt back into shape.

I’ve found the Kingpin’s arc to be the most interesting thread in Zdarsky’s run on the comic—seeing a crime boss flounder when running up against super-rich white-collar criminals is straight out of the antihero playbook, but it’s wild how effectively Zdarsky twists you into sympathizing with Fisk, even when Fisk inevitably reverts to violence to get his way.
