Perhaps this shouldn’t have been my first experience with John Ford’s writing. The world Ford creates is an intriguing blend of professional magic and steampunk technology, with a layer of political intrigue mixed in. It’s not a spoiler to say this world comes to an abrupt end, because Ford never finished the novel. I wish I could’ve read the completed story (or potentially stories, it feels like there’s enough here for a series).
