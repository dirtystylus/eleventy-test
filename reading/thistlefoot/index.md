My teammate Victoria recommended this to me and I enjoyed it a lotâ€”it only took me this long to finish it because I took a break to read [*Babel*](/reading/babel). *Thistlefoot* centers on siblings Bellatine and Isaac Yaga, who may have inherited mystical powers (and accompanying trauma) from their ancestors, victims and survivors of the Russian anti-Jewish pogroms. This family history is dredged up when they inherit a house with \[checks notes\] *chicken legs*. GennaRose Nethercott somehow manages to make that detail feel both incredible and completely within the realm of possibility. What ensues is a weird and thrilling chase across different parts of the country, in a story that mixes fairy tales, road-trip hijinks, and a zombie-like horde of infected humans.
