I’m liking what Coates is doing so far in his Captain America run. Like Superman, Captain America is such a straight-arrow character that in the right hands he can be a good way to probe themes of heroism amidst corruption. I do wonder about the limits of how far you can take that, though: at a certain level most superheroes function akin to cops, and I’d be shocked if Marvel let any writer, even Coates, follow the trail of corruption all the way to its very roots.
