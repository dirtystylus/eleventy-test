Five minutes into what was supposed to be a reread of *Hard Light* I was convinced that I had not, in fact, read it. After a few more chapters it slowly dawned on me that yes, I most likely *had* read it, but that realization was not accompanied by the story rushing back in sharp detail. Instead I was left with the unsettling feeling of memory lining up with the words on the page as I read them, not unlike a ground-glass viewfinder snapping into focus in a manual SLR camera.

The story that Cass Neary stumbles into is a collision of the things that have propelled the series so far: drugs, music, and damage handed down from generation to generation[^1]. I can’t wait to finally sink into the latest installment, [The Book of Lamps and Banners](https://www.elizabethhand.com/books-list/cass-neary).

[^1]: Even after I’d established that I’d read Hard Light, I kept mixing up parts of the story with Marisha Pessl’s [Night Film](https://marishapessl.com/book/night-film/), which also deals with a cult film and family secrets.
