I enjoyed this—the characters are messy in funny, tragic, and affecting ways. The plot is a lot less melodramatic than you would expect given the setup in the first chapter. I was curious how much “trans culture 101 for cis folks” would make its way into clunky expository dialogue—there *is* a bit of that but I was often thankful for it.
