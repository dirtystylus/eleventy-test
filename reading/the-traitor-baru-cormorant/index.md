A friend recommended this one to me, and I can definitely see why: I want to see more fantasy/science fiction books deal with colonialism as a central theme, instead of background fodder and spice for tired old storylines. Unfortunately this felt like the draft of a larger, better book. Perhaps it suffered too much for my having read it so soon after Tamsyn Muir’s [*Harrow the Ninth*](/reading/harrow-the-ninth/), where the writing is so smart and so funny—Dickinson sets up a plot but everything feels rushed, like a series of exposition cards in a movie. I wanted to *feel* my way through Aurdwynn’s world, but the book rarely pauses to build its characters and ground them in a sense of place. Like [Foundryside](/reading/foundryside), it’s another series where I won’t venture past the first entry.
