It’s been a while. Reading has definitely slowed down for me over the past two months, mostly due to work.

I picked this one up, read a few chapters, and then put it down for several weeks before returning to it and finishing it over a couple of days. It’s quite ambitious in its formal structure—there’s multiple books within this book, and Ozeki plays around with first, second, and third person narration. It’s…a lot. I liked it but would probably recommend *A Tale for the Time Being* over this one.
