*New Waves* is largely set in startup land, and lots of the situations echo things I’ve seen/experienced in that world over my career. There’s a lot in here about the different layers of racism and sexism in startup culture, especially with respect to Black women; I find myself wondering about the limits of exploring those topics given the way the narrative arc is set up for the central Black character. 

Overall I found it funny, and sad. I was originally going to return it to the library, unread, but I’m glad I chose to read it. It reminded me how seldom I get to read fiction with an Asian man as one of the primary characters.
