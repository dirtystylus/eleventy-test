Oof. This took me a lot longer to read than I anticipated. Probably because this one is basically the story of Cromwell’s demise. So much dread, and the knowledge that he’s going to miss the signs that lead to his fall from grace. Also, reading this during a time of incredible job insecurity was making me paranoid about my own job.
