Reading this after [*Spear*](/reading/spear) felt like a thematic continuation—a story of a woman growing into her power, shaping the world around them in ways commonly reserved for men at the time. It also reminded me somewhat of Hilary Mantel’s *Wolf Hall* trilogy, with its focus on the interior life of its protagonist set against the political and religious forces of the day.
