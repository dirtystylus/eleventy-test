Jordan read this a few years ago, and I thought it would be a light, quick diversion since I’ve been having trouble getting back into books the last couple of weeks (you can see the string of comics I’ve been reading instead). It didn’t turn out to be as light as I imagined—it was more Dickens meets David Mitchell’s *The Bone Clocks*. The ending feels a bit rushed, ironically—after some interesting world-building the central tension and its resolution are curiously underwritten. Still, I can see Hollywood adapting this (a quick check shows that it actually is in development, with Benedict Cumberbatch mentioned as a possible lead).
