I’ve had this on my shelf for a long time, and it seems like I found my way to it at the right time. I felt a lot of resonance with [The Vaster Wilds](/reading/the-vaster-wilds/). Maybe a bit of [A Children’s Bible](/reading/a-childrens-bible/) as well.

Diane Cook’s tale acts both as a work of speculative fiction for the future, as well as an allegory for the past and how Indigenous peoples of the Americas faced the aggression of European colonialism.
