My teammate recommended this one to me, with the warning that it’s set in Ireland during the global flu pandemic of 1918. It’s both very good and very infuriating, for reasons I can’t explain without spoiling too much. Donoghue sets everything at a really high pace—you really feel the exhaustion of central character Julia Power as she wills herself through a relentless couple of days in a Dublin nursing ward for pregnant women.
