*The Cartographers* has a fun premise—what if maps help shape our reality?—and that generates a lot of momentum even if the execution is a little hit-or-miss. It reminded me a bit of Jane Pek’s [*The Verifiers*](/reading/the-verifiers/), and I wish I had read this in one big gulp because it would have left me less time to think about various plot points/holes.
