I’ve had this on my list of potential reads since its release, always hovering somewhere in the middle—never quite dropping off, but never quite reaching the top, either. Last year a friend mentioned it a couple of times,[^1] and when a paperback copy finally showed up in our neighborhood Little Free Library, I decided to give it a shot.

It’s a long book, but if you’re a fast reader that might be less of an issue than the story, which has a lot in common with the Book of Job from the Bible. How much crushing humiliation and pain can one person bear? At times it reads like an eight hundred-page recommendation for therapy. It’s been a while since I’ve read something so aggressively unkind to its characters. The drumbeat of despair is so constant that when I hit a key moment late in book—one presumably intended to wring a deep emotional response—I felt numb, inured to the pain these characters were created to bear.

I’m not always put off by stories like this—Rebecca Makkai’s *The Great Believers* kept popping into my head as one recent novel that contained a similar amount of pain and despair,[^2] and I really responded to that book. I think my core issue with *A Little Life* is that its main character comes off as opaque, not just to the other characters in the book, but the reader as well. Jude St. Francis is closed-off, self-loathing, and withholding, and even though Yanagihara explicitly spells out Jude’s internal life he only rarely emerged as a three-dimensional character for me. Your mileage may vary, of course—the prose is absolutely beautiful in parts, but it also feels like a cheat, part of this book’s ruthless determination to make you cry.


[^1]: In recommendation, I thought, but it was more of a warning.
