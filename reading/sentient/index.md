I like the setup: A long-haul space colony mission goes awry; ship AI Valerie takes care of the survivors. In practice, though, some of the more interesting ideas get passed over for a more straightforward horror/thriller approach.

For folks who are intrigued by the ship-AI subgenre but want something a little bit more expansive, Ann Leckie’s [Imperial Radch series](https://annleckie.com/novel/ancillary-justice/) or Becky Chambers’ [Wayfarers series](https://www.otherscribbles.com/#/thelongway/) might make for good reading excursions.
