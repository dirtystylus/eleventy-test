My friend Sam mentioned he had been reading this one, in the middle of a discussion about creativity and profit motives and AI art. I found a copy via my local library and read it slowly over the past month. While it shows its age in many areas, it is instructive to see how writers in the 70s were sounding the alarm about the sources of the neoliberal mess that we now find ourselves in. Schumacher’s notes on industrial scale, care for natural resources, and the environmental impact of nations mimicking the USA’s extravagant consumption patterns—these are all very relevant today.
