I can’t remember when I started reading this one, so I’m just dating it to when I finished. G. Willow Wilson finishes her run on Ms. Marvel, and Saladin Ahmed takes over. I like how they’ve teased the deeper mystery of how Ms. Marvel’s powers work, and I think they’ve handled Bruno’s return well. The tension between Bruno and Kamala is unresolved, but I like how the writers have them living in that awkward space.
