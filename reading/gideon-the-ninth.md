I … don’t really know what I read? It’s like _Clue_, mixed with some stock galactic empire tropes (different houses, each with a different speciality, natch), plus the throne room scene from _The Last Jedi_, a little bit of _Portrait of a Lady on Fire_, directed by Guillermo del Toro in _Hellboy_ mode? And it somehow works?

I wonder what the follow-up will be like.
