I’d been meaning to read this for a while, and stalled so long Jordan finally gave it to me as a gift. I was very curious how N.K. Jemisin would treat a Green Lantern character, since they’re basically…galactic cops. Jemisin confronts this head-on by having Lantern Sojourner (Jo) Mullein be a former police officer *and* soldier from Earth. Her history as a Black woman in uniform comes to the forefront when she is assigned to investigate a murder at The City Enduring, where three different species live together in a fragile peace. 

Jemisin uses the people and politics of The City to examine some pretty deep topics: queer identity, state violence, voter suppression. The parallels to politics in the United States are often explicit, but Jemisin works them into a good space noir plot with some interesting twists on how Jo’s Lantern ring powers work. The writing here is fun, perhaps closer aligned to her recent book *The City We Became* than the *Fifth Season* books.[^1] The character designs and artwork by Jamal Campbell are very, very good.

[^1]: There’s a clever economic setup in the story that allows Jemisin to work in lots of pop culture references.
