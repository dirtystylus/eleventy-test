The second book in the [*Outline*](/reading/outline) trilogy. These books are so unconcerned with plot, or maybe it’s better to say they push against the expectation that plot is the reason for a novel. There were moments reading *Transit* where a scene unspooled slowly, taking me along, building tension, until I realized I was feeling like I was holding my breath, and all of this was being generated by characters on the page telling a story. I’m ignorant of the particular style/movement that Cusk is continuing/building with these books, but I definitely sense some of the formal hallmarks.
