*Haven* has a setup straight out of a horror film: a priest named Artt has a vision of a remote monastery, and he sets off with two monks in tow. They drift in the Atlantic until they alight at the island known as Skellig Michael. Donoghue  paints the monks as an invasive species on the remote island, and she slowly reveals how badly religion has separated Artt from his own humanity.
