If this were a tv show this would be the big story reboot to launch a new season. Which is just as well, because my library didn’t have Volume 3.

Surprised to see Michael Chabon pop up here, writing a supporting mini-series to the central story. Apparently he was a big fan and that led to him contributing to the series[^1].
