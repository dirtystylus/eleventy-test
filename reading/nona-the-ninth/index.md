We were expecting *Alecto the Ninth* and instead got a surprise third entry into what is now a tetralogy. My friend Mandy pointed out how in each book Tamsyn Muir has changed her narrator(s) as well as how they deliver information to the audience, and now it’s all I can think about. Formal scaffolding aside, Muir’s brought the same inventive world-building, sly (and not-so-sly) meme references, and delight at trolling her audience[^1] that have made the series such fun, while also building to some truly heartbreaking scenes. Can’t wait for *Alecto*.

[^1]: There were some character names and jokes that were brilliant and yet *so* puerile, they left me gob-smacked.
