Several weeks ago I posted about using [Kill the Newsletter!](/posts/kill-the-newsletter/) to turn your email newsletters into RSS (Atom) feeds. Shortly after that [Lucy Bellwood pointed me](https://twitter.com/LuBellWoo/status/1354115803486908416) to this [post by Chris Coyier on Email is Good](https://email-is-good.com/2021/01/26/spam-intermediary/), which details how to use Gmail to forward your newsletter emails to [Feedbin](https://feedbin.com). I’m a Feedbin user so I use a modified version of Coyier’s recipe: I set up a filter for my existing email newsletter subscriptions, forwarding those emails to my built-in Feedbin email address.

For future signups I’ll use Coyier’s technique for setting up a naming convention. I wasn’t sure if it would work with my custom domain instead of a vanilla `@gmail.com` address, but a quick test confirmed that it does.[^1]

[^1]: I’ll probably have to figure out this part again, in the future. One of my longer-term goals is to get off Gmail; I’m thinking of [Fastmail](https://www.fastmail.com) or [HEY](https://hey.com).
