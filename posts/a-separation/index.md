I’ve had [*A Separation*](http://www.sonyclassics.com/aseparation/) on my viewing list for a very long time, and I finally watched it. Having just watched [*Columbus*](/posts/columbus/), I noticed a similar theme of familial obligation competing with an opportunity for growth (and perhaps escape).

I didn’t know anything at all about Asghar Farhadi’s work, but I really appreciated the film’s examination of how religion gives structure/meaning to life, but also constricts and shuts off communication that could have prevented the tragic interactions that occur between some of the characters.
