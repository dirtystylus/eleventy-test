[R.O. Kwon](https://ro-kwon.com), author of [*The Incendiaries*](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/549116/the-incendiaries-by-r-o-kwon/) (one of my favorite books from last year), was [recently a guest on the Strong Feelings podcast](http://www.strongfeelings.co/podcast/e67/). Hosts Sara Wachter-Boettcher and Katel LeDû, and R.O., got into a host of topics: perfectionism/procrastination, writing, losing one’s faith, Asian American representation, healthcare…basically the things that I think about a lot. Definitely worth a listen.
