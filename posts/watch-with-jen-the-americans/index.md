Jen Johans[^1] is one of my favorite film critics, and her podcast *Watch With Jen* has been a great resource for discovering film/tv over the last couple of years. For her [recent episode on FX’s *The Americans*](https://www.patreon.com/posts/watch-with-jen-70336915) she was joined by Roxana Hadadi,[^2] another one of my favorite writers. They talked about the things that made the show special: the handling of politics, the acting, the costuming (and wigs!) and especially the music. Now I want to do a rewatch.
