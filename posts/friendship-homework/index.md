I enjoyed this lovely aside in one of Robin Rendle’s [recent posts](https://www.robinrendle.com/notes/hyperbolic-time-chamber-v3):

> Whenever we talk my phone tends to fill up with notes for books to read and websites to surf. In fact, I can always tell how much I completely adore someone, and it’s this: whenever I walk away and I’m genuinely excited for all the homework.

I love it when folks are genuinely excited to share things that they love, and do it with a posture of, “I can’t wait for you to experience this too”.

I sometimes tell people that my love language is links, and that if I send you a bucketful of semi-related URLs it’s the deepest expression of love and care.
