A while back I wrote a [short comment on an interview](/posts/image-quality-is-a-red-herring/) with an Olympus rep:

> The dedicated camera manufacturers were so busy competing on their industry’s accepted selling points—image quality, speed of operation, focal length coverage—that they were completely blind to the way an always-connected device could transform photography.

Two things came out of the recent Photokina festival that caught my eye, because they represent two different takes on how a connected camera could work.

## [Zeiss ZX1](https://zx1.zeiss.com/)

This is the territory of the Ricoh GR-D/Fujifilm X100/Leica Q/Sony RX1—niche, but definitely *my* niche. What’s different here is that Zeiss seems to have embraced the fact that image capture is just one part of the equation. Baking Lightroom and cloud connectivity directly into the camera — instead of setting up a Bluetooth + WiFi bridge to an app on your phone—feels like a step in the right direction. I have no idea whether it’ll be any good—it’s taken the X100 about four generations to reach maturity, for comparison—but I love that Zeiss is thinking about the entire process including editing and posting shots. It doesn’t appear that you can post straight to a social network like Instagram, tho, so I’m wondering if that’s *just* enough friction to call the whole concept into question.

## [Pixii](https://pixii.fr/)

[This one](https://pixii.fr/) takes a different approach—an M-mount camera with no screen that’s connected to your smartphone. I guess the lack of the screen isn’t *that* out of the ordinary ([Leica’s upcoming M10-D doesn’t have one, either](https://www.theverge.com/2018/10/24/18015840/leica-m10-d-camera-announcement-specs-price)). I’m wondering how effective the smartphone pairing will be (having used the Bluetooth + WiFi feature on a number of different cameras, I can say that so far I haven’t seen anyone pull this off convincingly just yet). In some ways this modular approach might be more sustainable than the Zeiss all-in-one concept.

## iOS Tethering

While I was checking these cameras out, I wondered if there wasn’t a slightly lower-tech approach. Studio photographers already make use of [tethered shooting](https://petapixel.com/2017/07/31/shooting-tethered-pays-off-guide-photographers/), why not explore wired tethering straight to a phone library? The recent shift to USB-C on the iPad Pro made me think that this could be an interesting possibility if the iPhone follows suit. I know, cords = hassle—but it might sidestep the software issues that I feel will hold both Zeiss and Pixii back with their first-generation products.
