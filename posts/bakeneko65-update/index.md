A quick update on the [Bakeneko](/posts/bakeneko65): the stock springs in the Gazzew Linear Thock switches were indeed too stiff—after a few days my forearms were tingly with the familiar signs of my RSI flaring up. Max offered to swap the springs out for me but I decided to do it myself. I ordered 57g springs and some GPL 105 Oil Lubricant from [Divinikey](https://divinikey.com) and spent an evening popping the switches open and then replacing the old springs with the newer, softer ones. So far it’s better and my RSI has subsided. I’d say that I could probably even use a lighter spring, but we’ll see how I feel after these ones have broken in.
