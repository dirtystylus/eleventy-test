Not everything in [this movie](https://www.netflix.com/title/81005150) works — see Emily VanDerWerff’s [post about the ending](https://www.vox.com/culture/2020/5/1/21241881/the-half-of-it-ending-spoilers-netflix-review), for some thoughts on why — but I enjoyed it overall, and it’s great to see Alice Wu making movies again. I watched her first film ([Saving Face](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0384504/?ref_=fn_al_tt_1)) not long ago, unaware that she hadn’t made another feature since. The New York Times had a [feature story](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/29/movies/the-half-of-it-alice-wu.html) that dove into some of that history. Vulture also had a good [interview with Wu](https://www.vulture.com/2020/05/saving-face-alice-wu-is-back-with-netflix-the-half-of-it.html).

Nitpicking about the plot aside, though — I loved some of these shots from a sequence in the second half of the film:

![Layered shot with reflection in the water seeming to touch the foreground character’s face.](the-half-of-it-02.jpg "The layers here! Blurred out foreground, touching a reflection from the in-focus background, like an upside-down kiss. Image © Netflix."){data-responsiver=cinemascope}

![Mirroring faces, almost like a landscape.](the-half-of-it-03.jpg "Image © Netflix.")

I like the way that Wu uses perspective and the reflection from the water to frame the two characters so that they seem to be touching and mirroring each other. I found that stripping out the color helped me see the forms/composition a little bit easier:
