Took a quick trip with the family to New York City at the end of March, since Jordan and I skipped our traditional anniversary trip last December. I dug out my old Fujifilm [X100S](/posts/fuji-x100s/) and had a lot of fun taking photos (more on that later). I’ve posted a full set [on Flickr](https://flic.kr/s/aHBqjBk6Uv).

## Day One

We stayed near Koreatown, and on our first morning starting in the Flatiron district, stopping in at Eataly and the Harry Potter store.

We walked downtown to Union Square for lunch and a stop at Strand bookstore.

We wrapped up the afternoon with a quick trip to Little Island, then had an early dinner at [Her Name is Han](http://www.hernameishan.com).

## Day Two

Breakfast at Sullivan Street Bakery, then a walk along the High Line up to Hudson Yards

After the high line we stopped in at B&H, Moynihan Train Hall, and then rode up to Central Park. I have to say, seeing my kids figure out the right Metrocard swipe technique after a few tries really warmed my heart.

We capped things off with a late lunch near our hotel and then got back on the road to head home.

## Camera Notes

I have a [Fujifilm X100VI](https://fujifilm-x.com/global/products/cameras/x100vi/) on order, and it’ll probably be in my hands in May.[^1] In the meantime I dug up my Fujifilm X100S. I’ve owned since 2015, but I haven’t shot it much the last four years because I broke the power switch.[^2] On this trip I remembered how much fun it is—having an optical viewfinder is great when shooting street scenes, and the low-profile lens makes it jacket-pocketable and easy to drop into a sling/purse. It kinda made me wish I had brought it on my [long trip last year](/posts/philippines-japan-2023-part-1/).

It’s funny, too—a lot of the limitations I used to gripe about don’t affect me as much. Probably because my kids are a lot older, I’m no longer chasing them around and missing shots due to slow autofocus. Back then I had a [short wishlist of improvements](/posts/stuck-in-manual/):

> * A tilt screen.
> * Flexible noise-reduction settings for JPG output.
> * Faster, more reliable autofocus with the focus joystick from the X-Pro2.
 
The first item came with the X100V, and the latter two have been solved since the X100F.

The X100 line has definitely turned into *a thing* in the meantime, though. Whereas people used to ask if I was shooting a film camera, or a Leica, this time around I got asked whether I was shooting the new VI. Kudos to Fujifilm, even if it means I have to wait months to get mine.

[^1]: Or June? The demand for this camera has been ridiculous to the point that stores have had to publish posts like [this one](https://www.shopmoment.com/reviews/how-to-actually-get-a-fujifilm-x100vi).

[^2]: I spilled a cocktail on the top plate, the power switch got really sticky, and when trying to loosen it up I broke the internal stops. It still turns on/off, but it’s really easy to nudge it to either state.
