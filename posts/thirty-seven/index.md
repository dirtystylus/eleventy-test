The word that comes to mind for this past year is *continuity*. Two years ago was filled with a lot of change. There was less of that this past year, but there was still plenty that came to mind.

- I’m still working at [Bluecadet](http://bluecadet.com), surrounded by some very talented people. Right now I’m doing a mix of code, technical strategy, and technical direction. I don’t know that I’ve found the right mix, but I’m in a good place to figure it out.
- I spoke at Drupaldelphia last fall.
- I had an [article published at A List Apart](http://alistapart.com/article/prototyping-your-workflow), something that’s been a goal of mine for a while.
- I wrote more. Even if only a few things made it up to this blog, my Editorially history at least tells me I’m getting more stuff out of my head and onto the page.
- I embraced Editorially, and then saw it [shut down](http://dirtystylus.com/2014/06/06/thank-you-editorially/).
- I finally finished Moby Dick, and then Readmill [shut down](http://readmill.com/).
- My wife and I continued to lead our community group at our local church. A few of our group members are going to end up leading their own groups this fall, which bittersweet. I’m taking it as a sign that we did well as leaders.
- Speaking of our group, we read through Galatians and I came away with a renewed appreciation for the gospel as a constant, minute-by-minute thing, not a thing from which you graduate.
- My niece Hannah was born in November.
- My niece Melanie was born in April.
- My friends and I got to eat at [Talulah’s Table](https://www.flickr.com/photos/dirtystylus/sets/72157645151592485/).
- My eldest daughter started reading. She finished preschool this Spring, and starts kindergarten this fall. I know where the time went. It still surprises me.
- My younger daughter finally started giving out kisses. She also started speaking in well-formed sentences and can now hold a conversation with me.
- I taught another semester of my online class in WordPress and PHP at [MCAD’s Continuing Education program](http://www.mcad.edu).
- [We spent some more time in Maine](https://www.flickr.com/photos/dirtystylus/sets/72157645828497200/) with Jordan’s family.
- I got to see my brother graduate with his PhD.

A pretty good year, now that I think about it.
