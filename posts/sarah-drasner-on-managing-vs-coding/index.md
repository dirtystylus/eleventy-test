The other night I caught up with an old colleague and we talked about how it’s harder to feel immediate gratification as a manager, and how that’s often a struggle for devs because the dopamine feedback loop for code is often quite short.

Yesterday [Sarah Drasner tweeted this](https://twitter.com/sarah_edo/status/1174756325684727808):

> Sometimes @dizzyd and I talk about how management cycles are much longer than engineering cycles- meaning it takes a lot more time to see if something was effective or failed. It's why it can be very rewarding, but probably why I still need time to code (hello dopamine!)
