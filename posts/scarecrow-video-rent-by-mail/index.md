With Netflix [winding down its iconic DVD-by-mail service](/posts/rip-netflix-dvd/) at the end of this month, this was a pleasant bit of news to read: Scarecrow Video, Seattle’s famous independent video store, is rolling out a [rent-by-mail service](https://www.polygon.com/23870135/scarecrow-rare-movie-rental-mail-united-states-netflix). I had heard rumblings that they were field-testing this back in the [early days of our ongoing pandemic](https://www.thestranger.com/slog/2020/05/08/43630074/scarecrow-videos-rent-by-mail-program-is-a-blessing) but I’m thrilled now that it’s available to the wider public. As far as I understand it the [model](https://scarecrowvideo.org/rent-by-mail) is:

* Up to six discs out at a time
* Rental fees for each disc + $12 flat fee for shipping
* 14-day rental window

That’s different from the Netflix subscription model with shipping baked into a monthly fee, so my usage may end up skewing more towards things unavailable on my current set of streaming services. Still: Scarecrow’s collection dwarfs Netflix’s current library by about 10:1, so I’m excited to give it a try.
