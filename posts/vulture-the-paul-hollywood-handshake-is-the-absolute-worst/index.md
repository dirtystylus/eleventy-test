Brian Moylan, [writing for Vulture](https://www.vulture.com/2019/09/great-british-baking-show-hollywood-handshake-bad.html), captures the unctuous bundle of self-satisfaction that is Paul Hollywood:

> Admittedly, part of what fuels my hatred is that the commendation is coming from Paul, the beautiful, blue-eyed physical embodiment of manspreading. It’s almost like his arm-pumping is mansplaining baking to us. As Anoosh Chakelian writes in the *New Statesman*, “you can just see the blokey pleasure twinkling in Hollywood’s eyes when he swings his right arm out. The smug smirk. The eyebrows raised in *can you believe I’m praising you?* mock-benevolence.”

I don’t even remember noticing “the handshake” while watching earlier seasons, but while watching one of the recent episodes on Netflix I turned to Jordan and said, “It looks like they’re trying to make this A THING.”
