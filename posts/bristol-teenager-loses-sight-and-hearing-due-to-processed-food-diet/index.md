[The Guardian: Teenager loses sight as eating disorder leads to malnutrition](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/sep/03/british-teenager-loses-sight-and-hearing-due-to-processed-food-diet).

At first I thought this was one of those stories crafted for clicks, and it is that, but it’s also quite sad — it’s not about a kid ignorant about diet and nutrition so much as an actual eating disorder:

> The boy suffers from an eating disorder called Arfid (avoidant restrictive food intake disorder). Sufferers become sensitive to the taste, texture, smell and appearance of certain types of food.  
> …  
> He was not over or underweight, but was severely malnourished.
