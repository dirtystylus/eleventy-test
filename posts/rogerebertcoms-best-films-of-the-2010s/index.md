[The list](https://www.rogerebert.com/balder-and-dash/the-best-films-of-the-2010s), and [where to watch them](https://www.rogerebert.com/balder-and-dash/the-best-films-of-the-2010s-where-to-watch-them).

I have mixed feelings whenever I see “best-of” lists, but looking back at the last decade at least allows some of the critical dust to settle. Perhaps it’s simply more interesting to me when it’s a list of someone’s favorites, like [this list started by Alanna Bennett](https://mobile.twitter.com/AlannaBennett/status/932061584955867137).
