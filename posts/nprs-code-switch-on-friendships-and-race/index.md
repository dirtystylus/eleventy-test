This two-part podcast from NPR’s Code Switch and WNYC’s Death, Sex, and Money really struck a chord with me — from the discussions on the distinctions between work-friends/friend-friends, to how folks handled the micro and macro-aggressions from their friends. The sections dealing with the malleability of Asian American identity and its adjacency to whiteness also sparked a lot of recognition on my part.
