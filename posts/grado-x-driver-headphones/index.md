[Grado has updated their Prestige Series headphones](https://blog.gradolabs.com/x-driver-prestige-series/) with their new X Driver, and refreshed cables and headbands. I’ve had an original pair of SR80s for over twenty years and it’s nice to see an overall refresh to the line. I wonder if that cable is more flexible than the classic[^1] one. 

At the start of the pandemic I picked up an [RS2e](https://gradolabs.com/headphones/reference-series/item/7-rs2e) so none of these are calling my name, but I’m quite curious to hear how those new drivers sound. 

[^1]: Generally one of the most infuriating parts of Grado headphones—it’s thick, and prone to twisting—I find myself having to spin the earcups a couple of times to let them settle before putting them on.
