[Apple returns to their old keyboard design](https://www.apple.com/macbook-pro-16/).

I kid, but I’ve ranted enough on Twitter about how I still haven’t adjusted to the design decisions Apple made with their ill-fated butterfly keyboard. We get the return of the physical Esc key, a return to the superior inverted-T arrow key layout, and a (hopefully) more reliable switch mechanism.

I’m not in the target market for the 16-inch MacBook (too big) but I hope to see the new keyboard design trickle down to the 13 inch and Air models.
