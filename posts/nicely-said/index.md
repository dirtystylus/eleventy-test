*Nicely Said* is the new book on writing by Nicole Fenton and Kate Kiefer Lee. It’s fantastic and [you should go get it](http://www.nicelysaid.co/).

Writing about writing is not an easy task, but Nicole and Kate have managed to craft a book that is practical, funny, and full of empathy, the kind that stands as a living example of its own advice:

> Good content is clear, useful, and friendly.

I appreciated the consistency of the book—I never felt like I was reading two radically different authors crammed together. It felt like a cohesive work that exemplified how you can have a consistent voice and tone for an organization or collaboration.

*Nicely Said* moves quickly from the general (research, planning, process) to the specific (developing your voice and tone, writing for user interfaces/flows, style guides). As a developer writing isn’t my primary job, but it’s one that I’m doing more and more frequently. So I appreciate how *Nicely Said* is both broad enough to be inspiring, but also specific enough that I can use some of the suggestions right away. Through it all, Nicole and Kate balance practical tips and examples with humor and kindness.

Kindness may seem like a strange word to pluck out of a book that deals with the power of words, but there’s a sense of generosity that pervades the book. It’s hard to put my finger on it, but it feels a lot like a friend telling you how they approach their craft, instead of a dry manual. It’s only now that I write this that I get the double meaning of the title—that writing clearly and effectively doesn’t preclude being pleasant and welcoming.
