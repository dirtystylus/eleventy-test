[This is a helpful list](https://austinkleon.com/2020/05/13/if-you-are-having-trouble-reading/), and over the last couple of years I’ve found myself doing more and more of the suggestions here: reading more than one book at a time, quitting books early, reading with my kids, having my kids assign me books to read — I think the one hurdle I haven’t tried yet is _writing_ a book.
