For 2020 I decided to watch more movies, and at the outset I thought that this would result in me reading less. But due to the Covid-19 crisis I wasn’t commuting, so my consumption of both was quite even: 110 films, 99 books.[^1]

I found that my viewing sources were heavily weighted to three:

* My local video store, [Viva Video](http://viva-video.com)[^2]
* The Criterion Channel[^3]
* HBO Max[^4]

This year I signed up for Netflix’s legacy DVD service, to fill in the gaps. Usually if something isn’t streaming I can find it at my video store, but there are occasional dead spots in their library.

[^1]: Books and comic collections, for the purists out there.

[^2]: If you have a local video store, support it! The clerks at Viva have helped me delve into so many different, interesting areas this year, particularly in the realms of screwball comedy and film noir.

[^3]: I wish I had supported FilmStruck while it existed. I have quibbles with the Criterion Channel’s UX, but I’ve been pleased by their programming (it feels more diverse than the disc-based Collection).

[^4]: Confusing rollout and questionable strategy aside, the movie library on HBO Max has been surprisingly deep and varied.
