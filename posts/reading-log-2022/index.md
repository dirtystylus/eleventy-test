I read [forty-one books](/reading/years/2022/) in 2022, and looking back I see a lot of thematic resonance in the books I chose:

* *Lots* of time travel (or time travel-ish) stories: [*This Time Tomorrow*](/reading/this-time-tomorrow/), [*Blackout*](/reading/blackout/), [*This is How You Lose the Time War*](/reading/this-is-how-you-lose-the-time-war/), [*The Midnight Library*](/reading/the-midnight-library/), [*Sea of Tranquility*](/reading/sea-of-tranquility/), [*The Shining Girls*](/reading/the-shining-girls/). What is my subconscious trying to tell me?
* [*Spear*](/reading/spear/) and [*Matrix*](/reading/matrix/) bouncing off each other in a back-to-back duet
* [*Homeland Elegies*](/reading/homeland-elegies/) and [*Concepcion*](/reading/concepcion/) each exploring what it means to be an immigrant in the USA, in this particular political moment

Some favorites:

* Finding Ada Palmer’s [*Terra Ignota* series](/reading/too-like-the-lightning/) via friends
* Diving back into the Oxford time-travel series via [*Blackout*](/reading/blackout/) and [*All Clear*](/reading/all-clear/)
* Another [*Locked Tomb* book](/reading/nona-the-ninth/), which again raised more questions than it answered
* The NY nostalgia of [*LaserWriter II*](/reading/laserwriter-ii/) (thank you Max, I have to return your copy)
* Finally reading [*Neuromancer*](/reading/neuromancer/), which was a little bit like finally getting the joke
* [*Cloud Cuckoo Land*](/reading/cloud-cuckoo-land/) and its mix of characters and eras

I definitely found it more challenging to read in sustained bursts last year, just due to my work and my kids’ school schedules. I also continued to watch a lot of [movies](https://letterboxd.com/dirtystylus/films/diary/for/2022/), trading that for reading time. Instead of setting a numeric reading goal for 2023 I think I’m going to focus on discussing what I’ve read with friends.
