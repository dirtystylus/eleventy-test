In June and July my family I took a trip to the Philippines and Japan. It was my parents, my brother’s family, and Jordan and our girls. My parents had been planning this for a while—we had thought it would happen a couple of years ago and had been looking at the summer of 2020, but the Coronavirus pandemic obviously set things back quite a bit. I think in the end it worked out, our kids are older and were better able to handle the travel.

It had been a long time since I was in either place—25 years for the Philippines, 18 years since I last visited Japan. So this was a long time coming.

I decided to break up the trip into a number of posts:

* DC to Coron/El Nido
* Puerto Princesa/Iloilo/Cebu
* Bohol
* Manila
* Tokyo

## Delays, but a silver lining

We met up with my brother and his family to fly out of Dulles, and our itinerary was blown from the start. We had a 4+ hour delay due to mechanical issues, with United flying parts from San Francisco. That meant we would miss our connecting flights in Denver and Tokyo on the way to Manila. There were seven of us traveling, so rebooking us was a challenge. Eventually we ended up getting rerouted through San Francisco, where we would stay overnight and catch an early flight to Tokyo. The silver lining was we got to see our good friend Jill, who hung out with us that evening and the next morning.

## Coron

After our long flight to Tokyo we transferred to an ANA flight to Manila. We met up with my parents and spent a quick night there and the next day got on a flight to Coron in Busuanga, Palawan. We had never been to Palawan before, so this was a first for everyone in the family. Coron struck me as being on the upswing in terms of building out its tourist attractions. We got in midday and were fairly tired, but Joseph and I got to hike up Mt. Tapyas and to see the bay

The next day we got to squeeze in a tour that brought us to to some cool lagoons. Outrigger boats were our primary way of getting from island to island. We had lunch cooked on the boat: grilled tuna, eggplant, seaweed, and veggies.

## Gear Miscellany

### Protography

* X-T30 with a 50mm: a bit too tight for some of the photography, miss having an X100
* iPhone 11: great for wide angles, phone bag for water

### Phones

* ESim from Airalo worked great for data, no local number tho
* Dad had a physical SIM but wandered into the ocean and lost his burner phone

### Whatsapp

* United had WiFi support for Whatsapp. When we finally got it working it was ok for coordinating seat shuffles on the longer legs
* WiFi/IP-based chat was blocked by our VPN, so that’s a note when connecting
