J: At quizzo last night we missed the question on who killed the Hydra. We thought it was Theseus…

S: No, Theseus killed the Minotaur.

Me: What about Jason? And the Argonauts? Who did they slay? Medusa, right?

E: No, Medusa was Perseus. Jason had trouble after marrying Medea…

S: \[*mumbles something indistinct*\]

J: Did you just say she was a murderer?

S: Uh huh. She was a stone-cold murderer. Medea.
