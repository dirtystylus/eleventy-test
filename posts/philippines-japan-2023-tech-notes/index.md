## Cameras

I was traveling with family, which made this an interesting trip from a photographic viewpoint—there was less time to wander about and immerse myself in a scene. More snapshots and grabbing things on the move. Here’s my [album from the whole trip](https://flic.kr/s/aHBqjAV99V).

### Stills

I used my iPhone 11 and my Fujifilm X-T30 (with a 35mm lens) during the trip, with the iPhone used for wideangle shots and the Fuji acting as a 50mm-equivalent short telephoto. This worked ok, but I quickly found that 50mm was too tight for a lot of the shots I wanted to take (landscapes, cityscapes), whereas the iPhone 11 lacked the editing latitude even when shooting in RAW. 

I think next time I would actually flip the equation: go back to using the Fuji X100 series[^1] for the bulk of shooting, and pair it with an iPhone Pro (or Pro Max for even more reach) for the occasional telephoto framing. Either that, or just go all-in on on the phone camera. I do still prefer the both the shooting experience and output from a dedicated camera, but even I can see the difference on both fronts is shrinking.

### Video

Video, on the other hand: it’s not even a question. My X-T30 takes very nice video, but it’s not terribly useful in the field because the camera is not stabilized. I used it for a few videos where I could position the camera in one spot. But for everything else I used my iPhone, and it’s…perfectly fine, even for a four year-old phone. I’m consistently impressed with how Apple hit the Goldilocks zone for video—it still blows my mind that you can get stabilized, 4K video in your pocket.

### Editing

I process both photos and video using [Darkroom](https://darkroom.co), which allows me to edit on my phone, iPad, or laptop. It does a good job with video, too, which means I can tweak curves/color just as easily as for photos. Editing on my iOS devices was important, because I decided to travel without my laptop.[^2]

## Cell Service

eSIM for the win—we used [Airalo’s Asialink](https://www.airalo.com/asia-esim/asialink-30days-3gb) option which gave us data connectivity in the Philippines and Japan. It doesn’t give you a local phone number, but we found Whatsapp to be a decent workaround for VOIP calls.

## Carrying things

I used an Amazon Basics 20-in hardside suitcase (fine, unremarkable). Luckily summer travel meant a lot of lightweight clothing. I wanted something that I could carry on but I think in the future I would opt for a larger suitcase and just check it.

For my carry-on gear I used a [Bellroy Venture Backpack](https://packhacker.com/travel-gear/bellroy/venture-backpack-22l/), which appears to be discontinued. I liked the hook attachment for the top flap, and the low-profile water bottle pockets. The main compartment opens fully, which made packing/unpacking very easy. I fit a packing cube with a change of clothes, my camera, and my iPad and all my chargers. Downsides? It’s a bit heavier than I would like, and the sternum strap can be annoying—it tends to latch when you take the backpack off, making for a rude awakening when you try to put the backpack on again.

For walking around I used a [9L Bellroy Venture Sling](https://bellroy.com/products/venture-sling?color=ranger_green&material=baida_nylon&size=9l#slide-0). It’s pretty big for everyday use, but I chose it because I could fit a camera, a small 12 oz water bottle, and a packable windbreaker. I’m pretty happy with it although I wish the strap got a tiny bit tighter, for less movement when it’s not fully loaded.

[^1]: I got the X-T30 back in 2019 as a stopgap, waiting for the latest version of the X100 to be released, which turned out to be the X100V. I figured I would pick one up before our trip, but did not anticipate the camera being impossible to find, due to a combination of production issues as well as a spike in popularity due to…Tiktok. I almost took my old X100S on the trip, but mine has a wonky power switch and the autofocus is pretty slow.

[^2]: I went back and forth on this decision for a while, but I eventually left it because I wanted to make sure I didn’t do any work, and once I drew that line there were very few other things that necessitated a laptop.
