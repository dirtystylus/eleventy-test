Serenity’s [Apple Pencil review](https://www.imore.com/pencil-review) encouraged me to try out the Pencil/iPad Pro combination. Her [review of the 2018 “regular” iPad](https://www.imore.com/my-97-ipad-2018-review-drawn-written-edited-and-produced-ipad "My 9.7 iPad (2018) review: Drawn, written, edited, and produced with an iPad") is impressive in terms of depth of context and analysis alone, but when you add in the fact that she produced everything using the iPad itself, it becomes a compelling case for Apple’s evolving vision of what a [“not-computer”](https://www.apple.com/ipad-pro/films/) can be.
