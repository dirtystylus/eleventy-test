Stopped just south of City Hall to experiment with the [Pinwide](http://wanderlustcameras.com/products/pinwide.html) outdoors in bright sunlight. This first one was probably the best of the bunch, with the ghost of a woman crossing in the middle of the street layered on top of another woman standing on the concrete island in the background:

Five seconds appeared to be the sweet spot. I actually started out with a 15-second exposure, but that looked something like someone opened a rip in the universe on Broad Street:

Two seconds, on the other hand, is just a bit too dim:
