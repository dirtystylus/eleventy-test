MacStories’ John Vorhees on a [Kickstarter project to develop a programming/design curriculum for girls](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/designcodebuild/marshmallow-run-game?ref=nav_search "Kickstarter: Marshmallow Run") (well, everyone, really):

> …the reward that’s most interesting is a programming starter pack for backers who pledge just $25. The starter pack includes character sprites and other game elements for building Marshmallow Run in Scratch.

Em and I spent part of last year following a [Pixelnest Studio tutorial](http://pixelnest.io/tutorials/2d-game-unity/) to build a simple *shmup* in Unity. I’m hopeful *Marshmallow Run* gets fully backed, because I’d love to try out the starter pack with Em.
