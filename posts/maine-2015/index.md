Some scenes from our annual trip to Maine. For the last few years we’ve stayed on a peninsula just outside of Freeport, near the Wolfe’s Neck state park. This year we got some pretty good weather for the majority of our stay.

There was, as usual, plenty of seafood.

My father-in-law, Mike, got a tandem kayak so the kids were able to go out on the water with a couple of adults.

There was also fun with sparklers.

We got to visit the Portland Children’s Museum, too.

Also, the beach. I grew up around tropical beaches, so I stay out of cold New England water as much as possible. The kids love it though.

Until next year.
