Love this design treatment for [Mubi’s screenings of *In the Mood for Love*](https://mubi.com/films/in-the-mood-for-love). I still have my 20-year-old Criterion DVD of *ITMFL*, but I have a feeling that [Criterion’s upcoming box set](https://www.criterion.com/boxsets/4117-world-of-wong-kar-wai) is going to end up in my collection one way or another.
