This [retelling of the Fury Road production](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/12/movies/mad-max-fury-road-oral-history.html) has been making the rounds in my various friend circles; has it really been five years? It’s wild to hear how the film almost didn’t have the Citadel scenes:

> He [Jeff Robinov] said, “The camera will stop on Dec. 8, no matter what you’ve got, and that’s the end of it.” We hadn’t shot any of the scenes in the Citadel yet, where the opening and closing book ends of the film are set, and we had to go into postproduction without them. It was almost incomprehensible.

I’m not sure how I feel about the [just-announced prequel plans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/14/movies/mad-max-sequel-furiosa.html) — it sounds like they’re recasting the Furiosa role, and I feel like that’s an even tougher casting choice than Tom Hardy stepping into Mel Gibson’s role.
