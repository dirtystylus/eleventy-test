You ever read/view something, say to yourself, “That would make a good blog post,” and totally forget to bookmark it? After my colleague Katie mentioned that the Philadelphia Museum of Art had a pencil bar, I told her I had *just* seen a post with behind-the-scenes videos of pencils being made.

Except: I didn’t have the link anywhere in my Pinboard, and my browser history didn’t turn up any hits. Turns out:

* I had read it via RSS
* It was on [Kottke.org](https://kottke.org/19/09/how-pencils-are-made)

The music on the Faber-Castell video is a bit … much, but I am fascinated by the multi-stage process. The Derwent video is (as noted by Jason Kottke) less slick, but it’s also more soothing as a result.

Some related bits ’n bobs:

* [A New York Times photo essay from last year](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/12/magazine/inside-one-of-americas-last-pencil-factories.html), with some great images from behind the scenes at the General Pencil factory
* [Pencil Revolution](https://www.pencilrevolution.com), a pencil enthusiast blog
* In the early 2000s I lived in a converted Dixon Mills (maker of [Ticonderoga](https://weareticonderoga.com) pencils) [factory in Jersey City](https://www.livingonthehudson.com/condo/dixon-mills). (It’s a bit shocking to me how much the real estate market has changed in JC.)

My friend Henry and I were discussing note-taking tools, and he mentioned that he’d been using some of the [Blackwing](https://blackwing602.com) line. I’ve always preferred a pen, but I’m starting to think I should give pencils a try.
