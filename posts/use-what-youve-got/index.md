Reading [The Setup](http://usesthis.com) is a reminder that some of the most creative people don’t obsess about their tools—they find what works and get on with the business of making things. [Today’s interview with Chris Onstad (Achewood)](http://chris.onstad.usesthis.com/) ends with the usual **“What would be your dream setup?”** question, and he replies:

> I can do whatever I want with those two forms of input and a keyboard. Mouse for sharper lines, tablet for free-form lines, voila. I guess I could get a smaller monitor, but this one is paid for. I might like to add a USB panini press at some point, or some kind of small toaster oven, perhaps the size of a perfect plate of nachos, for cooking waffles in. A toasted waffle with room-temperature cream cheese and Oregon blueberry jam is not unlike a small, personal cheesecake.
