My daughter started a printmaking class at [Fleisher’s Saturday Young Artists Program](https://fleisher.org/take-a-class/saturday-young-artist-program/), so we’re in downtown Philly a couple of times a month. Last time we dropped her off and we stumbled on [Mawn Noodle House](https://mawnphilly.com), a new Cambodian restaurant in South Philadelphia. We popped in for a quick lunch^[We only later found out that while Mawn doesn’t take reservations for lunch, dinner reservations are a hot ticket since they opened.] before taking a walk through the Italian Market.
