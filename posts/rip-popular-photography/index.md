DPReview, [on Popular Photography ceasing print publication](https://www.dpreview.com/news/8050322576/popular-photography-magazine-and-popphoto-com-to-close-after-nearly-80-years):

> The upcoming March/April issue will be the last, and as of Friday, March 10th, no new content will be published on PopPhoto.com. This news comes after the publication switched to a bi-monthly print schedule about six months ago.

Sad (if unsurprising) news—I still read *Popular Photography* regularly via my local library’s digital magazine bookshelf. Photo (and photo gear) blogs may have eaten up a lot of the attention and readership that *Popular Photography* used to command, but I still appreciated the way a coherent editorial vision could be expressed through a monthly (and later, bi-monthly) issue.
