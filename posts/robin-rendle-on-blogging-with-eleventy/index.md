Robin Rendle boils it down in his post, [“Eleventy and Netlify”](https://www.robinrendle.com/notes/eleventy-and-netlify):

> What do I need now? Well, I just need a box to type markdown in and a button to publish it.

Robin’s journey reflects a lot of how I’m approaching the future of this blog. I’ve basically narrowed it down to three broad choices:

- Stay on WordPress, but modernize the theme with [Timber](https://www.upstatement.com/timber/)
- Use [Gatsby with some Markdown plugins](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/plugins/?=markdown)
- Use [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.io)

Of those three choices I was initially most excited about using Gatsby, mostly because I find the component model of React to be helpful (in some cases). Gatsby has been iterating at a very fast pace, however, and I find that it’s always been a struggle to keep up with the tooling.

Eleventy feels like a more narrowly-focused option, and I like that (thus the quote from Robin above). I’m going to dig into it some more (I particularly have some questions on how search would work) but I was glad to see Robin documenting his decision-making process, as well as his journey through his new blog infrastructure.
