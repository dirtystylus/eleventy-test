Filed away for future use: [Big Dump](http://www.ozerov.de/bigdump/ "Big Dump"), a MySQL import utility. I was having trouble with importing a big SQL file to a database on a shared hosting planâ€”the import kept timing out. Big Dump gets around this by splitting large files and importing them sequentially. You set the config for your database, upload the php file and SQL to your webserver, and let it run.
