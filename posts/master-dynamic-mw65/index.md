Urbanears recently released a new Bluetooth, over-ear headphone, the [Pampas](https://www.urbanears.com/us/en/pampas.html). They struck me as a clone of [Master &amp; Dynamic’s MW60](https://www.masterdynamic.com/products/mw60-wireless-over-ear-headphones) over-ears, if you replaced all the metal and leather with plastic. I wandered over to M &amp; D’s website to confirm my suspicions, and—[hello, MW65](https://www.masterdynamic.com/products/mw65-active-noise-cancelling-wireless-headphones).

I’ve had a pair of Master &amp; Dynamic’s MH40s for [over three years now](http://dirtystylus.com/2016/05/05/master-dynamic-mh40/) and I’ve wondered when they would finally get around to a noise-canceling version. These look great; I eventually expect more colorways besides M &amp; D’s signature black/gunmetal and silver/tan. I will probably try them out at some point to see if they fit well and hold up against my train commute.
