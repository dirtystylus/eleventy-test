Last year I wrote this: 

> What’s next? For 2019 I’m less fixated on the volume of books. There were times where I felt good about tearing through my reading stack, but at times it felt a little bit like racing through a meal without really savoring it. This year my goal is to dig a little bit deeper and gather a bit more data about my reading, like the date I started a book and finished (or abandoned) it. I also want to record my notes and impressions instead of just logging titles.

Well. 

It turns out that I pretty much ignored my modest goals — I did gather a bit more data (date started, date finished) but on the whole it’s clear that I did not slow down and savor what I was reading. I realize that reading is a comfort thing for me, and sometimes I just need to gulp down large quantities of text. The world is terrible right now, and even when I’m reading non-fiction about difficult subjects it’s reassuring to feel that the horrors within are bound by the constraints of the book.

I’m hesitant to set goals for 2020, but I do want to figure out how to best update my reading log during the year, similar to how [Winston Hearn](https://www.winstonhearn.com/read/) and [Mandy Brown](https://aworkinglibrary.com/reading/) treat books on their sites. I’m loathe to use Goodreads, and it feels like giving this list a home on my site is the right move.
