My work machine is getting long in the tooth (it’s one of the 1st-gen Retina 13” Pros), so it’s nice to see a [major-version update to the Pro lineup](http://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/). This [note from Six Colors on the keyboard](https://sixcolors.com/post/2016/10/some-more-hands-on-experience-with-the-new-macbook-pros/) is both unsurprising and disappointing, though:

> Well, it’s my sad duty to report that the MacBook Pro keyboard has the same key travel as the MacBook. Apple says the stainless steel dome switch beneath each key has been honed to give you a more responsive feel, but to me it feels just like the MacBook’s keyboard. (To be fair, I don’t have a MacBook available to test directly. It’s possible that this keyboard does indeed feel more responsive than the MacBook, but I would never mistake it for the old MacBook Pro or MacBook Air keyboards or even the Magic Keyboard.)

I’ve tried the keyboard on the new Macbook, and I don’t really like it. But I suppose it’s the compromise for ever-thinner/lighter hardware.
