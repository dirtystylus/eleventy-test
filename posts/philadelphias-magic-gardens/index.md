Our friend Stef had told us about [this place](https://www.phillymagicgardens.org), tucked away on South Street. We went a week ago, celebrating Jordan’s birthday by spending the day in the city. It was cold, but that might have helped discourage crowds—we had a lot of fun just wending our way through the various tunnels and stairways.

There were two small, indoor galleries with some sculpture installations.

We went through one more time before we had to go.
