I had lost track of [Tom Tykwer](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0878756/) (*Run Lola Run*, *The Princess and the Warrior*) after the early 00s, but it turns out he’s one of the folks behind Netflix’s [*Babylon Berlin*](https://www.netflix.com/title/80136321). If you like noir mixed with historical fiction, set in a post-WWI, pre-WWII Germany, check it out. (If you’re already watching, Emily VanDerWerff is recapping the series with a rotating cast of tv critics on her [Episodes](https://emilyvdw.substack.com/archive?utm_source=menu-dropdown) newsletter.)
