Writing in Slate, Torie Bosch [rediscovers the value of DVDs/Blu-rays](https://slate.com/technology/2023/01/streaming-libraries-dvds-blu-rays.html), now that streaming services have started removing even their own original productions:

> I like to rewatch my favorite shows and movies, often as background noise while I do something else. And the idea that platforms are now removing even their original programming—which I had assumed was sacred—makes me worry about the future of other digital content, too. So I’m glad we hauled all of those DVDs and Blu-rays (even if I still think we could remove them from their cases and organize them some other way to save a bunch of space).

Jordan sent me the link to this story, and I felt both seen and trolled at the same time. The last few years I’ve grown convinced of the need for a physical archive for the digital things that matter to you. Make photo books/prints. Buy a copy of books/movies/tv that you reread/rewatch frequently.[^1]

But even disc-based physical media has an expiration date—I’m curious what the life span of a DVD or Blu-ray disc is: 20 years? 40? I’ve tried to archive some of my collection to MKV (partly for the convenience of streaming via Plex, partly as a hedge against disc rot). Perhaps what I really want is an open, non-DRM format for movies/tv that I can purchase and own without fear that they will become unplayable due to [expired rights or some other corporate whim](https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/23/22399008/apple-lawsuit-over-buy-and-rent-labels-for-digital-content-can-continue-rules-federal-judge). We already have this for music, despite the industry’s fears of piracy. Why not for movies/tv as well?[^2]

[^1]: A few years ago I experimented with Day One as a digital journal, but I’ve shifted back to paper again. This is partly because Jordan got me a fountain pen for Christmas and it’s such a pleasure to write with, but I like the idea that when I’m gone someone can read them without having to worry about some weird digital format.

[^2]: I wonder if the state of streaming libraries is more stable for music. Perhaps, due to fewer licensing rights to manage?
