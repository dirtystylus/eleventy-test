On the way back from the park, something finally clicked. I took my hand off Amelia’s bike seat and she was balancing on her own.

“I’M DOING IT!” she yelled, her voice a swirl of disbelief and pride. “I’M REALLY DOING IT!”

…and then she took off.

I broke into a run, and for a moment my heart was outside of me, floating right there beside her.
