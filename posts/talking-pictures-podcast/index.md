Enjoying the new [Talking Pictures podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/talking-pictures/id1722148571) from TCM and (HBO) Max. I’ve listened to the first two episodes (Nancy Meyers and Steven Soderbergh) and it’s a lot of fun to hear them revisit how they got their start, their films, and especially their personal favorites from other filmmakers. It’s also a fascinating window into the changing film industry (Meyers talks about her cancelled movie at Netflix, Soderbergh talks about retiring and unretiring). 

I will say that it still feels weird to have TCM—a vanguard of film appreciation and preservation—under the banner of (HBO) Max, whose parent company, Warner Brothers Discovery, has been responsible for some of the most reprehensible [film](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/batgirl-hbo-max-movie-dc-canceled-1235191932/) [cancellations](https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/coyote-vs-acme-warners-investigation-1235647011/) in recent history.
