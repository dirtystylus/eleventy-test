I’ve set up a [gist with my growing set of VS Code Key Bindings](https://gist.github.com/dirtystylus/5cb907738b5a0dd928345a719039f892), mostly an attempt to get it to behave as closely to TextMate as possible. So far the differences in column editing are where I find myself actively noticing VS Code instead of having it fade into the background. It also feels “heavy” for editing loose files (this could be a UI thing more than anything else, given TextMate’s extreme minimalism), so much so that I still often find myself ducking into TextMate if I have to, say, edit a random config file.
