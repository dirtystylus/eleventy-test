I didnâ€™t realize that MacOS Mojave had [unified screenshot/screen recording functionality](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208721#mojave), and bound it to a keyboard shortcut Shift-Command-5.

Except when I tried it all I got was the usual screenshot cursor, with none of the options detailed in that support post. After trying a few related shortcuts it dawned on me that CloudApp was hijacking the default keyboard shortcut. Quitting CloudApp/reassigning the shortcut then uncovered the default MacOS behavior.
