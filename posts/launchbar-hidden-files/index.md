Something that I didnâ€™t know until today: if you hold down the Option key when navigating to a folder within Launchbar, it will [show hidden files/folders in the listing](http://www.obdev.at/resources/launchbar/help/index.php?chapter=Browsing). Useful for editing config folders or shell profiles.
