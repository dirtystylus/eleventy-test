For the last year or so I’ve been using a [Drop Alt](/posts/drop-alt-a-keyboard-makeover/) 65% keyboard. It’s served me pretty well—it’s compact enough to fit in my desk tray, reducing my RSI. But over time there’s been a few nagging issues: the stabilizers rattle, and more annoyingly the board was prone to key chatter (doubling up characters). Pulling out and re-seating the switches would help for a time, but eventually I would get key chatter again. It began to feel like a game of whac-a-mole, where I’d fix one key only to have another one start chattering.

Enter the [Keychron Q2](https://www.keychron.com/collections/custom-keyboards/products/keychron-q2-qmk-custom-mechanical-keyboard). When Keychron released their first custom keyboard—[the Q1](https://www.keychron.com/collections/custom-keyboards/products/keychron-q1)—I was interested, but it was just too large for my keyboard tray. So I was happy when Keychron decided to release a 65% version.[^1] I grabbed on on release day, and within five days it was at my door.

I got the Q2 in a barebone configuration, since I didn’t really care for any of the switch/keycap options, and I also got the variant without the knob, since I route audio through my [Schiit Valhalla](https://www.schiit.com/products/valhalla-1) amp that has a nice volume knob.

A few months ago my friend Max sent me some five-pin Gazzew Boba U4 Silent tactile switches that I couldn’t plug straight into my three-pin Alt. The Q2 PCB is five-pin, though, so I dropped the Bobas in:[^2]

For keycaps I decided to go with my [Polycaps Octopus](/posts/polycaps-octopus-keycaps/) ones over the [SA Chalk](/posts/drop-alt-a-keyboard-makeover/) ones I originally had on my Alt.

The final result:

So far I’m finding it to be a pretty good alternative to my Alt. A few notes after a week of use:

* The key-mapping software [VIA](https://caniusevia.com) doesn’t support the Q2 out of the box yet, so Keychron supplied a JSON keymap that you can load into VIA manually.
* I find the south-facing LEDs more useful than the north-facing ones on the Alt. A tip for folks who want a solid color backlight instead of one of the RGB presets: toggle to the solid color option (default is red) and use the **Hue/Saturation +/-** function keys to find your preferred color (I set mine to a purple hue to match my keycaps). 
* The stabilizers come pre-lubed, but enthusiasts might still want to tune them (my left Shift key rattles slightly depending on what side you press on).[^3]
* Youtube reviewers have complained about the spacebar and how it sounds, but on my setup it’s quite muted and I really don’t notice it—YMMV, of course. 
* The gasket-mount setup is supposed to result in more flex as you type, but I don’t really notice it—could be that I just don’t use a lot of force while typing these days.[^4] If you’re prone to bottoming out while typing you might register more of that flex. 
* The Boba switches are a bit too stiff for my taste, but they’re very quiet—this is a setup that I could bring in to the office without any reservations. Obviously your choice of switches and keycaps will affect the sound profile of your setup. Max also gave me a batch of Gateron X linear switches, and I *may* like the feel of those more than the Bobas even though I’ve historically preferred tactiles. I may swap them in a few weeks down the road if I’m still finding the Bobas too stiff.
* A minor quibble: the top-right key (where the knob goes in the other variant) isn’t aligned with the top row of keys. I get that the knob might need more clearance but in my configuration it looks a little funny.

It’s been exciting to see the mechanical keyboard hobby explode in the last decade—I still remember how hard it was to get a proper [keyboard with Cherry switches](/posts/filco-majestouch/) about fifteen years ago. I see the Q2 as a mass-market, ready-to-ship, budget offering for enthusiasts who might tinker a bit with a board (swapping out switches/keycaps) but balk at lubing/tuning stabs and swapping out different plates/foams. I imagine folks who want a true custom board will skip over this to something like the [Mode Sixtyfive](https://shop.modedesigns.com/collections/keyboards/products/sixtyfive), [Parallel Portal](https://parallel.limited/pages/portal-1), or a [Vega](https://ai03.com/projects/vega).[^5] I’m fairly certain I’ll end up in that territory, but more for vanity (that top-right key!) than necessity.

[^1]: Keychron is also releasing a [60% layout](https://nextrift.com/keychron-q4-60-keyboard-coming-q1-2022-from-149/), and a [split layout](https://nextrift.com/keychron-q9-product-page-live-split-keyboard-from-149/).

[^2]: Except for the **CAPS LOCK** key, where I used a clicky Kailh Box White switch—it’s nice to hear that click when toggling it on/off.

[^3]: You’ll have to take the plate off to access the stabs, so this is probably something you’ll want to do before you put switches/keycaps on.

[^4]: Ironic, given that my former Domani Studios teammates dubbed me “Thunderkeys” after I brought a mechanical keyboard in and hammered away on it.

[^5]: All of those options are nicer but also require a wait (if they’re even available). There’s something to be said for Keychron producing enough quantities for immediate shipping. You also have to build those boards (the Q2 comes pre-assembled) but that might be part of the appeal for most folks.
