## Arrival

Flight from Manila was uneventful. We packed into two Grab cars and flew ANA into Narita.

We took the JR Express from the airport to the heart of Tokyo for the kids to experience the trains

Our Airbnb was located in Shinjuku, not too far from the Shin-Ōkubo JR station. It was accessed via a narrow alleyway, which held some surprises:

Once we got settled we tried to figure out dinner plans, which was a challenge with 9 people.[^1] Instead of trying to find a restaurant that could accomodate a large party we headed to one of the local grocery stores and assembled a meal from some of the packaged sushi/dumplings/etc

We crammed in and had a decent meal, then passed out in anticipation of a big day.

## Day One

### Asakusa/Sensōji

It had been 18 years since my last visit to Japan, and I had forgotten that the train system is a mix of Tokyo subway and JR-operated lines, so that made for some confusion, especially since we didn’t opt for the Suica/Pasmo transit cards for such a short trip. As efficient as the Tokyo transit system is, the UX of its vending machines could really use an update.

For lunch we found a small udon shop off Nakamise Shopping Street.

While some of us decided to go back to the shops my brother, my dad, and I went to the Asakusa Culture Tourist Information Center, which has an observation deck a few stories high.

### Imperial Palace

We boarded a tokyo hop on/hop off bus bound for the Imperial Palace

On the way back from the palace we happened upon a couple taking some wedding photos. At one point the photographer instructed the man to carry his bride and I was afraid he was going to drop her and ruin her dress.

The palace area was also great for fun signs:

{% endgallery %}


### Shibuya

Waiting for the hop-on/hop-off bus we took refuge at a the *Have a Nice Tokyo!* visitor center in the Mitsubishi Building. I liked the walls a lot:

![A large room with a patterned wooden wall. Small wooden stools are arranged in rows in the foreground, while in the background a woman seated at a small table speaks on her cellphone.](phl-jpn-tokyo-55.jpg)

Outside the center we encountered a security bot:

Our primary destination was the Nintendo store at the Shibuya PARCO shopping mall.

The Capcom store was just across from the Nintendo store:

Dinner brought a new experience for the kids: conveyor belt sushi! The sushi was heavy on mayo-based styles, perhaps to offset cheaper cuts of seafood?

We capped the night off by observing the famous Shibuya scramble, incredibly busy even on a weeknight:
