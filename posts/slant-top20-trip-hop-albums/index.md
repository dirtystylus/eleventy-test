Slant Magazine’s staff ranks [the 20 best trip-hop albums of all time](https://www.slantmagazine.com/lists/the-20-best-trip-hop-albums-of-all-time/). I own almost all of these albums in one format or another, and they formed a huge part of the musical soundtrack to my early 20s. I won’t quibble too much with the order—except to say that of the top three, Massive Attack’s *Blue Lines* is the one that I bring out every summer.
