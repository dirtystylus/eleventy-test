Ethan Marcotte with some [succinct, evergreen advice](https://ethanmarcotte.com/wrote/advice/):

> Set up a blog somewhere, anywhere, and write as much as you can. If I’m in a position to hire you, I don’t just want to see the quality of your final mockup, your finished set of templates: I want to learn how you got there. I want to read what worked, what didn’t, and the decisions you made along the way.

Ethan said in three-ish sentences [what took me an entire column to say](http://alistapart.com/column/write-what-you-know-now).
