Changing up the switches and keycaps took about an hour. Drop includes keycap and switch pullers, although be careful with the switch puller — it’s metal and can scratch the finish on the aluminum baseplate. I also suggest that you test the switches _before_ you put the keycaps back on — the switch connectors are pretty fragile and can get easily bent when you’re snapping them into the board — I had to fix and re-mount about four switches, and I found one defective switch that activated at the slightest pressure.
