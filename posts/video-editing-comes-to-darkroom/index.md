Over the past year or so Iâ€™ve simplified most of my photo editing workflow down to [Darkroom](https://darkroom.co) on the iPad. [This update](https://medium.com/the-bergen-company/video-editing-comes-to-darkroom-51f3103d267a) looks like an interesting first step in supporting video, but so far it seems restricted to cropping and applying filters and exposure/color adjustments. Operations like trimming the video clip would still need to be done in a separate app.
