Iâ€™m working on a project that needs to support files with varying levels of date specificity. Year, month, and day are the options, but the file may only have year (leaving month and day optional). Or it might have a year and month, but no day. The [Partial Date](https://www.drupal.org/project/partial_date) module appears to be a way to allow for that varying level of specificity.
