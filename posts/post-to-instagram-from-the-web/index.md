Instagram just rolled out [deeper web support](https://petapixel.com/2017/05/09/instagrams-new-mobile-website-lets-post-photos-no-app-required/):

I’ve been wanting this for a while—I like browsing Instagram via the web on my laptop, simply because the images are bigger (I have an iPhone 5, and Instagram doesn’t have an official iPad app).

I had to change my user agent to be Safari on iOS, but once I did that I got the `+` button to start the upload process.
