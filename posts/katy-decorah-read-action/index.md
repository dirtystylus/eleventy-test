You ever get the feeling that the idea you’ve got in your head already exists out there, but you just lack the right search terms to find it? While rebuilding my site and adding a [reading log](/reading/) I kept wishing that the manual steps (looking up a book, copying metadata, downloading the cover image) could be automated so that all I had to do was write my reading notes.

Well, enter this [helpful system from Katy DeCorah](https://katydecorah.com/code/read/), which looks like I could use with a few tweaks (I use YAML data in my Markdown front matter, but every book I’ve read is in its own folder).[^1]

[^1]: This also has me reconsidering my YAML data structure, and I can already hear the alarm bells ringing in my head.
