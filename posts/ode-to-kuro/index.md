The Verge with [an ode to the former Kuro TV line for Pioneer](http://www.theverge.com/2012/5/22/3024108/status-symbols-pioneer-kuro):

> Unfortunately for Pioneer, it was a boutique audiophile-style plasma TV manufacturer in a mass-produced LCD world. Not only were LCDs rapidly dropping in price and rapidly gaining in functionality, but modern plasmas had to battle against a bad reputation for burn-in, ghosting, power consumption and glare — even though most of the problems had long since been solved. In 2009 Pioneer sold off its TV business and patents to Panasonic, who has carried the plasma baton, but has yet to match the Kuro’s black levels.

You can pry my Kuro from my cold, lifeless fingers.
