I enjoyed [this series of quotes from independent bookshops](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/13/books/spare-a-thought-for-the-indies.html?action=click&module=RelatedLinks&pgtype=collection), illustrated by Bob Eckstein. This quote, especially:

> We are now able to sell wine. One dedicated woman has started purchasing a case of wine and books for her whole book group.
> 
>—Suzy T, The Book Cellar[^1], Chicago

During this socially-distant time I’ve mostly been supporting my local bookstores, specifically [Narberth Bookshop](http://www.narberthbookshop.com) (which does local-area stoop/porch deliveries) and [Harriet’s Bookshop](https://www.harriettsbookshop.com), which is located by my office in Fishtown.

I’ve posted this before, but if you’re near Philadelphia Eric Smith has a [list of indie bookshops you can support](https://www.ericsmithrocks.com/blog/2020/3/25/a-guide-to-helping-philadelphia-indie-bookstores).

[^1]: The Book *Cellar*! How appropriate that they’re selling wine. Also, I just now realized that it could be a pun on *Seller*. Bravo.
