> …the Fujifilm X100F will feature the 23mmF2 lens we find also on the X100/S/T

[via FujiRumors](http://www.fujirumors.com/fujifilm-x100f-will-have-a-23mmf2-lens-according-to-trusted-sources/). That makes sense. The existing wide/normal conversion lenses won’t need new versions, for one. But if this rumor is accurate I’ll probably just keep shooting my X100S, and look to something like the Pen F (for which I already have fantastic lenses). I think the lens on the X100 line is quite good for being so compact, but whenever I switch over to my micro-4/3 gear I find myself struck by the quality of the lenses.
