We’re out in Manahawkin, New Jersey, staying with my folks and my brother’s family at my family friends’ beach house (demolished by Hurricane Sandy and since rebuilt).

As their birthday gift to me Em and Soph performed a finger-puppet rendition of the first act of *Return of the Jedi*. Em and Soph hand-crafted finger puppets for the key players. My favorite was Bounty Hunter Leia, who Em kept referring to as “Alt-Leia”. They assembled Han-in-carbonite from Magforms. They also made Jabba’s palace out of a shoebox, complete with a trap door for Luke to fall into the Rancor pit.

The palace also transformed into Jabba’s barge—lifting the top reveals two paper sails that unfurl. A plastic Solo™ cup was the Sarlacc pit (yes, they did the scene where Boba Fett’s jetpack sends him into the pit).

We also made it to the beach on Long Beach Island.
