[The Verge: Sony Celebrates 40 Years of Walkman in Tokyo](https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/8/30/20840337/sony-walkman-in-the-park-tokyo-exhibit-anniversary)

I had a tape Walkman, and later a Minidisc one. Itâ€™s still wild to me how Apple ended up being the company to take the soul of the Walkman into the MP3 age and beyond.
