[Kill the Newsletter!](https://kill-the-newsletter.com) is a handy way to get an Atom feed for your email newsletter subscriptions. Plug in the URL for the newsletter and it’ll give you a custom email address to use for subscribing, and an Atom feed to use in your RSS reader.[^1]

[^1]: Because it auto-generates an email address that’s paired with the Atom feed, I don’t know that you can use it with, say, a paid newsletter tied to one of your personal email addresses.
