Margaret Lyons, writing in the NY Times *Watching* newsletter, on the show “Pushing Daisies”:

> Might you have guessed that “Pushing Daisies” was canceled after two short seasons? Of course it was. There are only 22 episodes, so watch slowly. I love this show so much that I have never watched the series finale, even though it aired in 2009. I just like knowing there’s one more episode out there, that the show is not over for me just yet.

I’ve never finished the last few episodes of “Deadwood”, but that might change now that [HBO has announced a movie with a potential arrival in 2019](https://deadline.com/2018/07/deadwood-update-hbo-tca-2018-1202433177/).
