Two unrelated, expensive, glowy things showed up in my feed at roughly the same time:

* A $17,000 [Leica M Monochrom “Stealth Edition”](http://us.leica-camera.com/Photography/Leica-M/Leica-M-Special-Editions/Stealth)
* A slightly-less-expensive ($4,000) [McIntosh MT2 turntable](https://www.mcintoshlabs.com/products/turntables/MT2)
