Looks like I’ve got [some work to do](https://kottke.org/19/06/the-best-books-of-2019-so-far).

Of the titles that Kottke highlighted I’ve only finished *Daisy Jones &amp; The Six*, which I really enjoyed. Helen Oyeyemi’s *Gingerbread* is also on my TBR pile (though I recently finished *Mr. Fox* and didn’t love it).
