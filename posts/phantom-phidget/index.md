I recently moved all my stuff off my aging black Macbook to a slightly-less-aged non-Retina Macbook Pro, and one of the weird side effects is a background Phidgets web service that asks for permission to run every time I reboot. I had long ago removed the Phidgets Web Service Preference Pane, but there’s a bunch of other files that were left behind. The [“Description of Library files” section here](http://www.phidgets.com/docs/OS_-_OS_X#WebService) had the list that I needed to wipe out manually.
