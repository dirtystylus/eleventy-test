I very much enjoyed [this piece by Nimit Shah](https://nimitnshah.com/adventures-in-design/landscape-of-literature.html) on how they put together visualizations of their reading using [The StoryGraph](https://beta.thestorygraph.com) and D3.js. Lots of inspiration for me as I think about future ways to visualize my own reading—I especially liked Shah’s topographical representation of genre.
