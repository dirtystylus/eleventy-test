A pleasant customer service story, for once: I bought a pair of [Philips headphones for the commute](http://www.usa.philips.com/c/Headphones/citiscape-collection-downtown-shl5605gy_28/prd/en/ "Philips Cityscape Downtown") and two months later the right channel went on the fritz. I figured I’d try and get warranty service for them, so I went on the Philips website, fired up the live chat option, and the person/bot on the other end gave me a reference number with instructions to send in a copy of my receipt. I did that, and one week later a replacement pair came with prepaid return shipping for the defective set. Not bad at all. Or perhaps my expectations are so low these days mere competence feels like concierge service.

The headphones themselves are pretty good—they isolate fairly well, and are small/light enough that they don’t feel cumbersome on my head. [Here’s a review from Inner Fidelity](http://www.innerfidelity.com/content/philips-citiscape-downtown "Review").
