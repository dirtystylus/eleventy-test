Partly motivated by HBO/Discovery’s [slash-and-burn run through their streaming library](/posts/vulture-tv-disappeared/), I started re-watching *Station Eleven*, and this time I’ve been listening to the [*Station Eleven* Podcast](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/station-eleven-the-podcast/id1599190589), hosted by show creator Patrick Somerville and film/tv writer Angelica Jade Bastién. It’s fascinating to hear them delve into the process of making the show, which went from a thing that I was hesitant to watch[^1] to one of my favorites from 2022.

One of the things I didn’t get into while linking to Kathryn VanArendonk’s recent [disappearing-tv piece](/posts/vulture-tv-disappeared/) was her link to a [Twitter thread by Patrick Sommerville](https://twitter.com/patrickerville/status/1602492077446676481), where he talked about the blink-and-you-missed-it physical media release of *Station Eleven* last October. That story apparently has a happy ending, with Paramount TV readying a DVD/Blu-ray/4K release in February. I’ve already pre-ordered a copy.

[^1]: Partly because I have such fond memories of the book, partly because of [waves hands] this pandemic that we’re still living in.
