In the past I’ve used the Chrome [Awesome Screenshot](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/awesome-screenshot-screen/nlipoenfbbikpbjkfpfillcgkoblgpmj) extension to take full-length screenshots of websites, but [this tip](https://umaar.com/dev-tips/151-screenshot-capture/) from Umar Hansa on how to do it using Chrome’s built-in Dev Tools is quite handy. (Hit Cmd+Shift+P to bring up the Command Menu, then type in “screenshot”.)
