Marius Masalar wrote up a very comprehensive overview on [using an iPad for the entire photography workflow](https://thesweetsetup.com/using-ipad-photography-workflows/), from planning a shoot to importing, organizing, processing, and publishing photos. It’s well worth a read — Marius mentioned a number of apps that I hadn’t yet tried (like [Priime RAW](http://priime.com/)), and his observations about the different import strategies mirror my experiences.

My personal workflow falls into two broad scenarios:

Camera-to-iPad
--------------

1. Use the in-camera RAW converter on my Fuji X100S to generate JPGs, then import those into the Photos app on my iPad Pro using the Lightning/SD card adapter.
2. Import those into VSCO.
3. Delete the unprocessed JPGs from Photos.
4. Process the photos in VSCO, export back to Photos.
5. Post to Instagram/Flickr/Google Drive/etc.

Very infrequently I will import a RAW photo instead of a JPG. VSCO can process RAW files, but I prefer using Lightroom because the edits are more controlled.[^1] In this scenario the Lightroom step happens before importing into VSCO. That’s…a lot of bouncing in and out of Photos: Photos to Lightroom to Photos to VSCO to Photos.

Computer to iPad
----------------

1. Import Photos to Lightroom on my laptop.
2. Make rough edits to exposure, then export JPGs.
3. Use VSCO’s [web uploader](https://support.vsco.co/hc/en-us/articles/203581060-How-to-Use-the-Web-Uploader-) feature to upload JPGs to my VSCO account.
4. Process the photos in VSCO, export to Photos.
5. Post to Instagram/Flickr/Google Drive/etc.

I tend to use this method when I’m working through a much bigger set of photos (say, a family vacation). I like that it doesn’t involve much back and forth between Photos and the other apps on my iPad.

Sometimes I will use Lightroom’s sync functionality to shuttle RAW files from desktop to Lightroom Mobile, but this is pretty rare — if I’m even opening my laptop then I might as well just quickly process a batch as described above.

Looking forward
---------------

I do wish that apps could import files directly, instead of requiring a stop in Photos. (Apps that are able to work directly with Photos instead of importing into their own library mitigate this somewhat, but it’s still a pain.)

I’ve got a 9.7″ iPad Pro, which is the one Pro model that [doesn’t support USB-C transfer speeds](https://jeffcarlson.com/2016/03/22/the-9-7-inch-ipad-pro-and-the-missing-usb-3-speed/) via the Lightning port. This is one of the reasons I mostly use the in-camera RAW converter on my Fuji — it makes the import step a bit faster (I just count how many JPGs there are to import, and I tick them off before the thumbnail previews even show up). I imagine that faster transfer speeds might make me use RAW files more frequently.

Why bother?
-----------

All these steps inevitably bring up the question: why not ditch the dedicated camera and just use a dual-camera iPhone? That would unify shooting, editing, and output into one single device.

The quick answer is that I don’t think the shooting experience is quite there yet in terms of controls. I like my dials and a viewfinder. But I will say that the *output* I see from the latest phones is getting pretty close to meeting my needs, and I have the nagging feeling that the next dedicated camera I buy could very well be the last one.

[^1]: In VSCO I find that extreme adjustments to highlights or shadows will affect the overall exposure too much. Compare the sun and sky in [this edit](https://www.flickr.com/gp/dirtystylus/9y239m) (VSCO for both exposure and filters) with [this one](https://flic.kr/p/W6vHdq) (Lightroom for exposure, VSCO for filters). In the first edit I tried to bring up just the shadows in VSCO, but it ended up affecting the highlights as well.
