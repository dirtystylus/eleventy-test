I used to use [MarsEdit](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/marsedit-blog-editor-for-wordpress/id402376225?mt=12&at=11l7ja&ct=tss "MarsEdit"), and [this review by Stephen Hackett in The Sweet Setup](http://thesweetsetup.com/apps/best-wordpress-client-macos/) is convincing me to try out the latest version. I’m writing this post in [Ulysses](http://ulyssesapp.com "Ulysses"), which is great, but so far doesn’t support editing existing posts.
