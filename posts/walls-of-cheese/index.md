Em: Daddy, what would you choose: walls of cheese, winning the Pennsylvania lottery, or being king of the world?

J: Walls of cheese would probably not be the draw for your daddy, who’s slightly lactose-into—

Em: Not walls of cheese, *walls of cheese*.

Me: …

Em: **W-A-R-S** would **C-E-A-S-E**.

Me: Oh. *Oh*. That makes more sense. Yeah, definitely that, because lots of people would benefit.

Em: I’d pick the lottery.
