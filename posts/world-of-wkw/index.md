Speaking of [*In the Mood for Love*](/posts/mubi-in-the-mood-for-love/), I received my copy of [Criterion’s new *World of Wong Kar Wai* box set](https://www.criterion.com/boxsets/4117-world-of-wong-kar-wai), and it’s quite beautiful. I’ve been making my way through the films slowly and I’ll have more observations later (the cleaned-up versions look amazing but also come with some controversial changes). For now here’s some packaging eye candy:
