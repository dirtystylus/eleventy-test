## Lime Time

We flew from Coron in the early evening—which was good, in that it allowed us to squeeze in an island tour in Coron. On the flip side, I was really feeling the jet lag by the time we arrived at our hotel (Lime Resort El Nido).

We had originally intended to see what tour packages the hotel offered but the markup was so high that my dad ended up searching around for a better provider, and the next morning we booked a custom tour via [El Bacuit Travel and Tours](http://elbacuit.weebly.com). Because there were nine of us so we could get a whole boat to ourselves—if we had been a smaller party we would likely have to share a boat with other groups.

## Big Lagoon

The first stop on our tour was the Big Lagoon on Miniloc Island, and our guide wanted to get us there early before the rest of the tour groups started to crowd in. We anchored offshore where there was a kayak rental station, transferred from the banka to kayaks, and paddled in. My dad and I shared a kayak.

The water was extremely clear and in the shallower parts it sometimes looked like the kayaks were levitating above the water, because you could see the kayaks’ shadows on the bottom of the lagoon.

The island cliffs were very interesting—apparently they’re limestone, and you could see the erosion at the water line as we paddled past.

Eventually our guides took us to a shallower end and tied up the kayaks, and we got to hop in the water for a few minutes.

## Entalula Island

After the Big Lagoon we hopped back on the boat and went to a beach on Entalula Island. There were small beachside bars where you could get fresh buko (young coconut) juice—they slice up the top and drop in a straw for you, or you can do like my daughter and sip straight from the top.

After you’re done with drinking the buko juice they cut up the coconut for you and you can scrape out the coconut meat inside.

## Seven Commando Beach

We could see the clouds rolling in while we were on Entalula Island, so we got on the boat to try and make it to Seven Commando Beach. We ended up running straight into pretty heavy rains, and we huddled tightly under the banka canopy. It didn’t help much, though—the rain was so heavy. I was impressed at the crew’s ability to navigate in the rain and fog.

We arrived at Seven Commando beach and it was very quiet, mostly likely due to the rain. The rain eased up and we swam for a while—a few of us even saw a sea snake, though I was glad that I didn’t witness that.

At this point we were pretty tired, jet lag and hunger were setting in, so we decided to skip a final stop and head back to the hotel. We hung out at the pool until it was time for dinner.

## Downtown El Nido

We grabbed dinner downtown at a small restaurant called Maa’s Grill where we stuffed ourselves with grilled squid, then walked down to the shore to look at the water and the boats.

## Lime’s Observation Deck

We wrapped up the evening on the pool/observation deck at our hotel, watching the rapidly changing light.
