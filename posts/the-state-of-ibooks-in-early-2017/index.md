Michael E. Cohen with a good post on iBooks: [The State of iBooks in Early 2017](http://tidbits.com/article/17053). I still miss dearly-departed [Readmill](http://readmill.com), but I’ve settled in ok with iBooks in terms of making my epub books available across all my devices.

I have experienced the same thing that Michael noticed with respect to iBooks “forgetting” his current place when switching devices:

> Occasionally, iBooks forgets to bookmark my current place in a book so it opens to the wrong page on another device.
