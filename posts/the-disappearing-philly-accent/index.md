[“The Why: Youse millennials are killing the Philly accent”](https://whyy.org/episodes/how-youse-millennials-are-killing-the-philly-accent/).

As someone who moved to the Philly area — as well as having lived in different regions of the US as well as abroad[^1] — I find this type of linguistic deep-dive fascinating.
