![ADC to HDMI to USB-C adapter chain](adc-hdmi-usbc.jpg "Daisy-chaining"){data-responsiver=cinemascope}

Last year I finally upgraded my work laptop to a 13" Macbook Pro. I rarely bring that machine home; when I did, I realized that I couldn't easily hook it up to my vintage 20" Apple Cinema Display (matte screens forever!). That monitor uses a DVI connector, which I currently have hooked up to my home machine using a [DVI-to-Mini DisplayPort adapter](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MB570LL/B/mini-displayport-to-dvi-adapter).

The first thing I tried was to daisy-chain that adapter to a [Thunderbolt 2-to-Thunderbolt 3 adapter](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MMEL2AM/A/thunderbolt-3-usb-c-to-thunderbolt-2-adapter), but my Macbook wouldn’t recognize the monitor.

After reading this [helpful thread](https://discussions.apple.com/thread/7633603), what finally worked was: HDMI-to-DVI adapter, connected to a USB-C hub with HDMI input. It’s not pretty, but it works. The USB-C hub happily accepts the pass-through USB from the display’s own USB/Firewire hub (although I'll always use the USB-C hub’s USB-A ports for better transfer speed).

The adapters I used:

* Apple HDMI to DVI Adapter: [https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MJVU2AM/A/apple-hdmi-to-dvi-adapter](https://www.apple.com/shop/product/MJVU2AM/A/apple-hdmi-to-dvi-adapter) 
* Vava 8-in-1 USB-C hub: [https://www.amazon.com/dp/B079GSMZ7G](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B079GSMZ7G)
