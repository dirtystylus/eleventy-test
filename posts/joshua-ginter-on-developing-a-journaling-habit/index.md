Joshua Ginter, [writing on Day One’s blog](https://medium.com/day-one/some-tips-for-developing-a-journal-habit-c3d3b798853#.u7lptwp69):

> One of those necessities: altering — or perhaps recognizing — the real definition of “journaling”. Many people associate “journaling” with penning complete thoughts into a pen-and-paper diary. However, “journaling” is really just a synonym for “recording”. You can record thoughts, sure, but you can also record a daily log of events, or fitness regiments, or what you ate for breakfast.

I like a lot of what Joshua shared in terms of his journaling mindset/process. Like Joshua, I have a daily journal that I keep in [Day One](http://dayoneapp.com). I found that setting a schedule helped build momentum early on (I have a reminder set for 10:30 pm, but these days I’ve usually written something before that goes off). Another thing that was helpful was setting no limit on subject or length: an entry could be about anything, and as little as one word.
