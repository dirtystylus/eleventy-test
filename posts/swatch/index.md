On New Year’s Eve day we took Amelia to the Swatch store at the local mall to pick out a watch. She’d asked Santa for this, and kept dropping strong hints leading up to Christmas: “All I want is the latest dragon book and a watch. \*Pause\*. Of course the other stuff would be nice too”.

Observing her pick out a watch was great fun. She wanted one with a clean face, that had hour markings, and a date indicator. We sensed that this was driven by a desire on her part not to have a “kid’s watch” with characters and strong colors.

In the end she chose a [monochromatic reddish-maroon one](https://shop.swatch.com/en_us/watches/originals/gent/redbaya-gr405.html). The rest of the day she called out the time at random, with such joy.
