Apple announced their over-ear, noise-canceling [Airpods Max](http://apple.com/airpods-max/)[^1]. It feels like these have been rumored for the last two-odd years. I like that Apple went with physical controls (the digital crown) instead of touch controls. If I were still commuting into the office I’d be interested in trying out a pair.

Lots of folks are going to complain about the price, and like many Apple products they are expensive (\$550 USD), especially when you can get Sony’s 1000XM4 for about half that. Apple is clearly going after the luxury tier occupied by models like [Master & Dynamic’s MW65](https://www.masterdynamic.com/products/mw65-active-noise-cancelling-wireless-headphones) (\$500) and [Bang & Olufsen’s H95](https://www.masterdynamic.com/products/mw65-active-noise-cancelling-wireless-headphones) (\$800). Still not the greatest look to be announcing these in a moment when a global pandemic has people struggling to pay for food and housing.

[^1]: Presumably they can name future versions Airpods *Pro* Max, or Airpods *Sport* Max, just for confusion.
