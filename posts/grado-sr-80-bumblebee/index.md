My Grado earpads had started to flake, so I sprang for some [yellow Sennheiser pads](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B002B4OEZ0/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o03_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1) that would fit. (I guess lots of folks do this, because the packaging had a sticker saying they could be used on Grados.)

So far itâ€™s been nice resuscitating these headphones, my first foray into decent audio.
