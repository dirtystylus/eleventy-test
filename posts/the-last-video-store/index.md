[A short mini-doc by The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/video/index/599239/video-store/) on Ardmore’s own [Viva Video](http://viva-video.com). The bittersweet tone is one I share — like the store’s owner, Miguel, I hope that Viva Video can keep going as long as possible. Streaming is more convenient, but I love that my family has a space like Viva Video where we can go, browse, get the staff’s opinion, and get a chance to experience the unexpected.
