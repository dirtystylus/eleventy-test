Bare Bones, [on TextWrangler’s future](http://us11.campaign-archive1.com/?u=d7ffaa16f302eaf61e416e389&id=5c0940cf9b):

> What you may not know is that last July, we released BBEdit 11.6. You can use this version unlicensed, forever, for free. Without a license, BBEdit now includes all of the features that TextWrangler offers, plus quite a few others. That’s right. You no longer have to pick between them.  
>  If this sounds like TextWrangler will eventually be sunsetted, you’re right; it will.

FWIW TextWrangler was always my go-to text editor if I had to do a simple find-and-replace in a massive text file (like a SQL dump). Where Sublime and TextMate would choke and beachball, TextWrangler always came through. Good to see that an unlicensed BBEdit version carries the torch.
