Writing for *The Ringer*, Katie Baker [looks back at the internet landscape of the last decade](https://www.theringer.com/2021/7/21/22586870/google-reader-ode-end-of-the-good-internet), through the lens of Google’s decision to kill Google Reader:

> The internet lasts forever, the internet [never forgets](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/18/business/media/teen-vogue-editor-alexi-mccammond.html). And yet it is also a place in which I feel confronted with an almost unbearable volume of daily reminders of its decay: broken links, abandoned blogs, [apps gone by](https://www.thewrap.com/mike-francesa-app-closes-down/), deleted tweets (miss you always, [*ah-well-nevertheless*](https://i.kym-cdn.com/photos/images/original/001/424/149/2bc.jpg)!), too-cutesy 404 messages, vanished Vines, videos whose copyright holders have requested removal, lost material that the Wayback Machine never crawled, things I know I’ve read somewhere and want to quote in my work but just can’t seem to resurface the same way I used to be able to.

> Some of these losses are silly and tiny, but others over the years have felt more monumental and telling. And when Google Reader disappeared in 2013, it wasn’t just a tale of dwindling user numbers or of what one engineer later described as a [rotted codebase](https://twitter.com/mihai/status/1138961875691950080). It was a sign of the crumbling of the very foundation upon which it had been built: the era of the Good Internet.
 
Like Baker, I’m skeptical about the myth of the Good Internet—I miss a lot of the wildly random nature of blogging’s heyday, but I suspect that a lot of that nostalgia is tied to a period when I was growing into myself. There is something to be said, though, for RSS facilitating easy, user-driven curation of content, something largely ceded to algorithm-driven feeds on platforms like Tiktok, Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram.

Also, it turns out [RSS isn’t even dead at Google](https://twitter.com/__apf__/status/1446503789586894850).[^1]
