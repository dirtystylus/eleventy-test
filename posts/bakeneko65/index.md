My friend [Max](https://maxfenton.com/) gave me an unexpected gift this week, a [lavender Bakeneko 65](https://cannonkeys.com/products/bakeneko65?variant=40711853113455) with purple switches and a lovely [DSS Easter](https://novelkeys.com/collections/keycaps/products/dss-easter) keycap set. I wasn’t shopping for a new keyboard given that I only recently picked up the [Keychron Q2](/posts/keychron-q2/)—but I had mentioned offhand to Max that in the future I would really love a lavender case, and here we are.

How does it compare to the Q2? I sent Max these quick observations:

* Everything feels…tighter than the Q2. That’s probably due more to the switches/stabs than anything else, but everything just feels a bit more solid.
* It’s less bouncy to the touch than the Q2. It’s an O-ring mount, and I’ve never typed on one before. To be honest I’m not sure how much I care about having a super-bouncy keyboard. I notice it on the gasket-mount Q2, but more in a neutral “this keyboard is kinda flexy” way as opposed to “I wish every keyboard was like this”.
* These Gazzew Linear Thock switches are not appreciably louder than the Gateron Yellows in the Q2, but they’re definitely lower-pitched. So if typing on the Q2 is all *tic-tic-tic*, this is more on the *toc-toc-toc* end. The springs in these switches are definitely stiffer, I’m seeing if that’s going to make my RSI flare up or not.
* I like the DSS profile on these keycaps. I noted to Max that I missed having F and J homing keys, and it turns out they were included with the set and I had just missed them. They don’t have a ridge but the profile is slightly deeper than the other keys, like my SA Chalk keycaps.

Overall verdict so far: fun! The Q2 is going in to the office next time I commute in to Philly, to replace the Topre Realforce I’ve been using there.
