I laughed a bit at the “Acclaimed Apple analyst” descriptor for Ming-Chi Kuo[^1] in [this GSM Arena piece about the rumored end of the line for the iPhone mini](https://www.gsmarena.com/kuo_iphone_14_to_have_48mp_camera_8k_video_no_more_iphone_mini_from_2022-news-48645.php), but I’m really quite sad that the mini doesn’t seem to have met with enough demand to justify its continued existence in the product line. Perhaps it’ll stay on as a fringe member, like the iPad mini or the Mac mini, both of which have been rumored to be dead products in the past.

I’m still using my first-generation iPhone SE; I’ll probably pick up a used mini if (as expected) iOS 15 isn’t supported on my phone come fall. I do really want a three-camera system on my phone, but I figure as long as I’m still carrying around a dedicated camera with a 50mm-equivalent lens, it’s probably better for my phone to have a wider-angle lens.
