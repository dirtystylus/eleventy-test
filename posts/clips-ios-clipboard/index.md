A quick follow-up to yesterday’s post: I found [Clips](http://www.cleanshavenapps.com/clips/), which functions as a system-wide, multi-item clipboard system on iOS. It works pretty well once you activate it as an alternate keyboard. The only point of friction I’ve encountered is that there’s no keyboard shortcut to toggle from the regular keyboard to the Clips one when using a Bluetooth keyboard — you have to toggle the regular keyboard up, then hit the globe key onscreen to switch. It would be nice if iOS 8 exposed that to the external keyboard so you could switch over, tab through the items, and just hit return to insert the clip.
