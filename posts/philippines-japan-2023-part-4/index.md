## Cebu

Cebu is the second-largest city in the Philippines, and in a different itinerary we would have spent more time there. For us, though, it was a quick transit point onward to Bohol. We had just a few hours to see the city before our afternoon ferry ride.

We were back to a smaller propeller plane for our flight from Iloilo.

## Alegre Guitars

We first stopped in at the Alegre Guitar factory to get a tour of their operation. All of their guitars are handmade, and we got to take a peek at some of the craftspeople working on guitars and ukeleles at varying stages of the process.

## 7D Mango Factory

{% aside "7D stands for “seven times more delicious”, just a tasty fact.", "right"%}

From there it was on to the 7D mango factory, where we took the tour of their sorting and packing operation. I wish we had gotten a peek at the earlier parts: slicing, drying, flavoring.

After the tour we stocked up on different varieties for the rest of the trip and gifts for friends/family.

## A Stop for Lechon

For lunch we stopped at Rico’s for some lechon—a place that our driver for the day said was one of the more popular spots. The lechon was ok but the skin was chewy instead of crackly, a disappointment. The squid, however, was quite good.

## The Ferry

After lunch we went to the port to catch our ferry to Tagbilaran, Bohol. On the way we made a quick stop to view Magellan’s Cross.
