## Cebu

Cebu is the second-largest city in the Philippines, and in a different itinerary we would have spent more time there. For us, though, it was a transit point onward to Bohol. 

We were back to a smaller propeller plane for our flight from Iloilo.

## Alegre Guitars

We first stopped in at the Alegre Guitar factory to get a quick tour of their operation. All of their guitars are handmade, and we got to take a peek at some of the craftspeople working on guitars and ukeleles at varying stages of the process.

## 7D Mango Factory

From there it was on to the 7D mango factory, where we took the tour of their production floor. The 7D stands for “7 times more delicious”.

Overall, though, the Kindle’s interface still contains too many overloaded interface elements. Craig Mod took a look at the Kindle interaction model in this essay, and much of his critique still holds true: What is the iOS Kindle interaction model? The iOS Kindle model is the “hidden spaces” model. That is, all active interface elements are invisible. This “hidden spaces” model of interaction is supremely user antagonistic.

After the tour we stocked up on different varieties for the rest of the trip and gifts for friends/family.

## A Stop for Lechon

We stopped at Rico’s for some lechon—a place that our driver for the day said was one of the more popular spots. The lechon was ok but the skin was chewy instead of crackly, a disappointment. The squid, however, was quite good.

## The Ferry

After lunch we went to the port to catch the ferry to Tagbilaran, Bohol. On the way we stopped real quick to view Magellan’s Cross.
