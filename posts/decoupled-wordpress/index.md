At WordCamp US 2015 [Matt Cheney](https://rychosis.org) and I will present our talk, [“Decoupled Development with WordPress JSON APIs”](http://2015.us.wordcamp.org/session/decoupled-development-with-wordpress-json-apis/). I’ve collected a number of resources here including Github repos for the example in the talk, as well as some links for additional reading on the topic.

## Slides

Slides are available on [Speaker Deck](https://speakerdeck.com/mllobrera/decoupled-development-with-wordpress-json-apis).

## WordPress JSON API Plugins

- [WP API v2](http://v2.wp-api.org).
- [JSON API](https://wordpress.org/plugins/json-api/). (Bluecadet used this for a lot of our early decoupled development.)

## Example Repos

- [WordPress REST API](https://github.com/dirtystylus/wordcampus-2015-rest-api)
- [Web page JS Example](https://github.com/dirtystylus/wordcampus-2015-js-example)

## Background Material

- [A List Apart On Air: “Love Your CMS”](http://alistapart.com/event/content-management).
- [Ryan Irelan’s bookmarks](https://pinboard.in/u:ryanirelan/t:alaonaircms/) for ALA’s “Love Your CMS”. (So much good stuff here.)
- My column on A List Apart, [“The Nearly-Headless CMS”](http://alistapart.com/column/nearly-headless-cms).
- Dries Buytaert, “[The future of decoupled Drupal](http://buytaert.net/the-future-of-decoupled-drupal)”. (I know, he’s talking about Drupal, but a lot of his insights into the advantages and disadvantages of decoupled CMS are worth reading.)
