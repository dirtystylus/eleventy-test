The Sweet Setup just updated their comprehensive [iPad photography workflow guide](https://thesweetsetup.com/using-ipad-photography-workflows/), and it’s probably the best thing I’ve read about using an iPad for importing/managing/editing your photos, especially if you shoot a dedicated camera. [Marius Masalar](https://mariusmasalar.me) has done a lot of work to talk about the different hardware and software involved, but also provides helpful reasons to choose certain tools/processes over others (for ex: a filter-based approach to editing, vs hands-on adjustments to exposure/color). 

My photography workflow is very basic these days compared to [when I last wrote about it](http://dirtystylus.com/2018/01/22/ipad-photography-workflows/), mostly because I replaced the Fujifilm X100S with an X-T30. Unfortunately, the X-T30 RAW files requires the latest version of Lightroom, which requires at least macOS 10.13 — but my home laptop is so old it tops out at El Capitan (10.11). (Let that be a lesson that upgrading one part of your toolchain can have a cascading effect on other parts). So my primary workflow these days looks like this:

* Use the in-camera RAW processor to generate JPGs (which are usually great to begin with, since Fuji has plenty of film simulations)
* Import those into my iPad’s camera library
* Use [Darkroom](http://usedarkroom.com) for adjustments (usually a little tweak to the curves for more contrast, and tweaking white balance). I used to use VSCO for filters but haven’t touched the app in over a year. 
* Back up RAW files to an external drive, which is cloned locally (using [SuperDuper!](https://shirt-pocket.com/SuperDuper/SuperDuperDescription.html), and to the cloud via [Backblaze](https://www.backblaze.com).

On the rare occasion that I want to edit some RAW files I import them straight to Lightroom on iOS using that program’s new [external device support](https://helpx.adobe.com/lightroom-cc/using/import-mobile-ios.html#direct_import), make my edits, and save JPGs into the camera library. I don’t do this as much because I have an older iPad Pro 9.7-inch model, which still uses a Lightning port, which means that importing RAW files is slow. You can start to see how aging hardware is a recurring theme in my life.
